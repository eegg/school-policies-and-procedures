Policy
------

We promote children's right to be *Strong*, *Resilient* and *Listened To*.


Procedures
----------

We:

* create an environment in our setting that encourages children to develop a positive self image, which includes their heritage arising from their

 * colour and ethnicity
 * languages spoken at home
 * religious beliefs
 * cultural traditions
 * home background

* encourage children to develop a sense of autonomy and independence.
* enable children to have the self-confidence and the vocabulary to resist inappropriate approaches.
* help children to establish and sustain satisfying relationships within their families, with peers, and with other adults.
* work with parents to build their understanding of, and commitment to, the principles of safeguarding all our children.
