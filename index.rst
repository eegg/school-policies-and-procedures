An introduction to this document
--------------------------------

This document sets out policies and procedures for |The Setting|.
That is, it lofty aim is to completely specify the behaviour that is required of all Staff,
such that |The Setting| can run stably and effectively.
That is to say,
neither the policies nor procedures are
'passive' documents or dusty lawbooks.
The reason for their existence is to provide useful information
for all parties to *The Setting*,
to be accessed at any stage of any predicament,
giving specific advice on how to handle the predicament.



A note on meta-policies
-----------------------

Consistent with the belief that this is an 'active' document,
these procedures will not simply work by sitting gathering dust.
It is therefore necessary to set out certain 'meta-policies'
to define how this document is used and enforced.
This document carries three such meta-policies:

* **Policy management.**
  This sets out how this document is learned and revised
  by the management and Staff that use it.
* **Enforcement and discipline.**
  In the event that
  a Staff member contravenes the procedures herein,
  or are accused of doing so,
  this sets out how accusations are confirmed or dismissed,
  and how possible subsequent discipline may be administered.
  For this reason,
  following the requirements in this document
  is a condition of employment
  for all Staff of |The Setting|.
* **Whistle-blowing.**
  |The Setting| encourages Staff
  to ensure that
  policies and procedures are enforced
  by reporting violations.


Policy structure
----------------

Each of our policies is divided into the following sections, in the following order:

.. container:: explanation

   **Why this order of sections?**

   The goal of this document is that
   team members can gain information as quickly as possible.
   In this spirit, the policies proceed from high-level aims (the *Policy* section)
   to low-level details (*e.g.*, the *Definitions* section).

+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Section                 | Contents                                                                            |
+=========================+=====================================================================================+
| **Policy**              | A prose section setting out the goals to achieve by setting out this policy.        |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Procedures**          | Specific, concrete instructions as to how                                           |
|                         | *Team Members* should act.                                                          |
|                         | This also covers guardians' and children's behaviour inasmuch as it covers          |
|                         | how *Team Members* should guide and instruct them.                                  |
|                         | Ideally *event-driven*: each subsection *X* covers what should happen in event *X*. |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Documents**           | Physical documents that should exist in *The Setting*.                              |
|                         | Details of their content and organization.                                          |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Basis**               | Any documents that were the theoretical or legal foundation of the document,        |
|                         | or were referred to in the policy or which may be useful for further reading.       |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Enforcement**         | How all parties are to be informed of the above Policies and Procedures.            |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **See also**            | Other sections of the Policies and Procedures that may be useful.                   |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Interspersed throughout the policy may be blocks of the following kinds:

* **Warnings** of things not to do in **red** boxes.
  By default, this document lists things that *should* be done.
  A list of things that *should not* be done would be endless.
  However, in cases that are 'tricky', warnings may be placed aside
  the explanation of what *should* be done in that situation.
* **Explanations** in **green** boxes.
  It is not the purpose of this document to rationalise every procedure herein --
  much of this rationalization underpins the legal documents that underpin this one --
  yet explanation will sometimes be required,
  such as where one procedure is read in isolation.
* **Definitions** in **blue** boxes:
  any terms, used principally in this policy,
  that require further definition, for reasons of legality or clarity.
  The definition should be placed aside the first instance of
  the term's use in the most relevant policy document.


Style
-----

From this documents reason for existence,
we can formulate some guidelines:

* terseness and clarity is preferable
  to duplication and fuzzy buzzwords.
  Where you feel you *might* be contradicting 'official' advice,
  give preference to sticking your neck out rather
  than being recoiling to fuzzy language.
* use plain English.
* model your procedures on a *flowchart*.
  Procedures should, where possible, be *event-driven*:
  when event of type *X* happens, staff member *Y* takes action *Z*.
* Do not directly address the potential readers of the document ('you'),
  and do not speak in the first person ('we').
* Structure the document for the ease of use of the staff member,
  not the parent or any other entity.
  The document will be learned and obeyed by members of staff.
* Do not end list elements with punctuation (commas, semi-colons, *etc.*)
* Do not end list elements with logical operators ('or', or 'and') unless necessary
* Do not use phrases like "staff should ...", or "we will endeavour that, where possible, ...".
  Instead state the ideal: "staff will ...".
* Use the active voice to assign duties:

  * **never** "the emergency services are contacted ..."
  * **always** "the *Illnesses and medication Officer* contacts the emergency services ..."


Phrases to avoid
----------------

* *LEA*, or *Local Educational Authority*.
  This phrase is now obsolete. [#lea]_
  Refer simply to the *Local Council*, or to the 
  *Director of Children's Services*.

Terminology
-----------

Throughout this document, if you unsure of a piece of terminology, check for it in the following list.
If there is anything else you are unsure of, please contact the nursery.

Guardian
  The *legal guardians* or carer.
  In most families this refers to the child's biological parent.
  This term is to be interpreted as neutral in gender and sexual orientation.

he, him, his
  We use the generic male gender exclusively throughout this document.
  Unless explicitly stated, pronouns are intended as gender-neutral.
  You may mentally replace this usage at your preference to *he/she*, *he or she*, *s/he*, *&c.*

Team Member
  An adult working within *The Setting*.

Staff Member
  A *Team Member* that is employed by *The Setting*.

Volunteer
  A *Team Member* that is not employed by *The Setting*.

Visitor
  An adult in *The Setting* that is not a *Team Member*.

Visiting Child Collector

Guest
  A *Visitor* that is not a *Visiting Child Collector*.


Policies, procedures: what's the difference?
--------------------------------------------

This document operates on a distinction between the *policy* and the *procedure*.
A rough distinction is that a policy sets out a *goal*, and an associated set of procedures sets out *how the policy is to be accomplished*.

Or, to quote:

  A policy is a guiding principle used to set direction in an organization.
  A procedure is a series of steps to be followed as a consistent and repetitive approach to accomplish an end result.
  -- bizmanualz [1]_

  Expressed in simple terms, policies are statements of what is required in broad terms and relate to major operational issues;
  procedures are more detailed, step by step descriptions of required actions, relating to how particular processes should be carried out.
  -- Rushcliffe Borough Council [2]_
