Policy
------

Our record keeping systems meet the requirements of the *Data Protection Act* and the *Human Rights Act*.
This policy and procedure is taken in conjunction with the Confidentiality Policy and our procedures for information sharing.


All information
and processes
in *The Setting*
are recorded
where:

* that information may beneficially contribute to the welfare of the child, or
* that information must be transferrable between *Team Members* without immediate contact, or
* that process or action must be recorded for legal reasons.



Procedures
----------

We keep two kinds of records on children attending our setting:

* Developmental records
* Personal records


Developmental records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* These include observations of children in the setting, photographs, video clips and samples of their work and summary developmental reports.
* These can be freely accessed, and contributed to, by staff, the child and the childâ€™s parents.


Daily observation
`````````````````

* For each child in our care,
  observations are made daily,
  using our Daily Observation Sheet.
* The Daily Observation Sheet is split into the EYFS Early Learning Goals.


Progress Reports
````````````````

* Monthly, the Daily Observation Sheets are collated by Early Learning Goal,
  producing a Progress Report.
* The Progress Reports should make clear
  any Goal to which attention should be paid --
  if, for instance, an unusually low or high level of progress has been made.



Personal records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These include:

* registration and admission forms
* signed consent forms
* correspondence concerning:

 * the child or family
 * reports or minutes from meetings concerning the child from other agencies
 * an ongoing record of relevant contact with parents
 * observations by staff on any confidential matter involving the child, such as developmental concerns or child protection matters

The personal record is:

* stored in a lockable file or cabinet and are kept secure by the person in charge in an office or other suitably safe place.
* accessible by the parents of the child to whom the record refers, in accordance with our //Client Access to Records// policy
* not discussed between staff, except where it affects planning for the child's needs, and
  our staff induction includes an awareness of the importance of confidentiality in the role of the key person.
* retained for three years after the child has left the setting.
