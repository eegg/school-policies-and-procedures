   Arrival
     The time between (1) the child and his guardian entering the setting to start a booked session and (2) the guardian leaving the setting

   Departure
     The time between (1) a guardian entering the setting to pick up their child and (2) the guardian and child leaving the setting
 
We aim to make arrivals and departures:

* quick
* efficient
* stress-free
* accurately recorded

It is essential that guardians always sign their children in and record the time of arrival on the daily arrivals and departures sheet.
The time is defined by the clock in the entrance hallway.


Procedures
----------


Determining the time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order that the actions of all staff and guardians are properly synchronized,
everyone determines the time by the *Authoritative Clocks*, which we provide such that:

* they are synchronized within two minutes of Greenwich Mean Time (British Summer Time)
* they are visible to guardians from outside *The Setting*


Arrivals
^^^^^^^^

Guardians must follow the following steps:

#. The guardian must wait until the defined start of their booked session before they enter the property
#. At the start time of the booked session, the guardian must signal their arrival at the *Setting Entrance*
#. They must only enter the propert when a *Staff Member* opens the door to them.
#. The child is surrendered to the care of his *Key Person*.
#. The parent signs the *Arrivals Sheet*, marking the time by the *Authoritative Clock*
#. The parent exits the property via the *Setting Entrance*

The *Security Staff Member* will always be at the door, to:

* ensure anyone entering is permitted to do so
* ensure that the door is closed securely after each exit and arrival
* ensure the safeguarding of all children

Also:

* Guardians are not permitted to open the entrance door to other guardians except with the immediate prior consent of the Security Staff.
* On arrival at the nursery a child will remain the responsibility of the guardian until they have been signed in.
* The responsibility will be handed back to the guardian at the point of signing out on departure.
* When collecting a child we do not permit any guardian to exit unannounced.
* To avoid disruption to our daily routine, guardians are requested that their child is present by the start of their booked session.
* We have the right to refuse admission if parents come late, which, except at the Manager's discretion, will be enforced on any guardian late by more than ten minutes.
* Any collector of the child must be entered into the additional collectorâ€™s section of the enrolment form by a guardian of that child prior to collection.
