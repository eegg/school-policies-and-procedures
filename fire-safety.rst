Policies
--------

The prevention of fire is of vital importance.
Most fires are caused by carelessness and ignorance.
It is the responsibility of all personnel to become conversant with these instructions.

Upon outbreak of fire the saving and preservation of life takes precedence over the salvaging of property.
A member of staff’s first duty is to look after the children and this will mean the evacuation of the building.
No attempt should be made to fight the fire until their safety is ensured, and then without exposing any person to risk.

We ensure our premises present no risk of fire by ensuring the highest possible standard of fire precautions.
The person in charge and staff are familiar with the current legal requirements.
Where necessary we seek the advice of a competent person, such as our Fire Officer, or Fire Safety Consultant.

* Staff must be aware that there are different extinguishers for different fires
* Staff members must know the following:

  * Your means of escape, primary and secondary
  * The nearest fire alarm point
  * The locations of all *Fire Appliances*, and how they should be used
  * The location of the *Assembly Point*


Procedures
----------

Procedures for fire and other emergency evacuation are displayed prominently in all rooms.
Fire drills are held once each term and this is recorded in our Fire Drill book.
The fire bell is rung and children are helped to put down games/activities and walked towards the door and then out to stand safely at the fence.

* Fire doors are never obstructed 
* Details are recorded in the fire drill book 

The fire procedure is displayed in the hall and all staff are familiar with the procedureStaff check all areas, pick up the register and phone and walk out with the children, where the children, staff and visitors are counted.
If necessary the fire brigade are called.
Arrangements are made to monitor the condition of all fire prevention equipment regularly.
This includes the visual inspection of fire extinguishers, and the testing of the fire alarm system.


* The basis of fire safety is risk assessment.
  These are carried out by a ‘competent person’.
* The manager has received training in fire safety sufficient to be competent to carry out risk assessment; this will be written where there are more than five staff.
  This will follow the guidance as set out in the ''Fire Safety Risk Assessment – Educational Premises'' document.
* Settings in rented premises will ensure that they have a copy of the fire safety risk assessment that applies to the building and that they contribute to regular reviews.
* Fire doors are clearly marked, never obstructed and easily opened from the inside.
* Smoke detectors/alarms and fire fighting appliances conform to BSEN standards, are fitted in appropriate high risk areas of the building and are checked as specified by the manufacturer.

Our emergency evacuation procedures are approved by the Fire Safety Officer and are:

* clearly displayed in the premises
* explained to new members of staff, volunteers and parents
* practised regularly at least once every six weeks

Records are kept of fire drills and the servicing of fire safety equipment.


Annual assessments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An annual risk assessment will be made by the *Health and Safety Team*. It will:

* Identify any person especially at risk in a case of fire, and make plans to include their safe evacuation.  This includes:

 * The blind
 * The deaf
 * The otherwise disabled

* Review the evacuation plan and each room's instructions for this
* Look at the past year's records of fire practices
* Ensure the provision of adequate training
* Review the Fire Risk Assessment sheets
* Review the provision of instruction to students or visitors to the building


Staff training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every member of staff will receive instructions in fire precaution during induction.
The training will be recorded in the fire logbook.
All members of staff will receive refresher training every 12 months.
Students and visitors will be instructed at the beginning of their attendance.


Fire drills
^^^^^^^^^^^

Fire drills will be carried out once a term.
This will include a simulated evacuation drill.
When a fire drill is held it will be recorded in the fire logbook.


Testing of fire alarm system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fire alarm system will be tested weekly by the *Fire Alarm Tester* and recorded in the logbook.

All staff will make it their responsibility to ensure:

* Their fire exit doors are unlocked when the first person arrives
* Fire doors will not be propped open
* Tops and fronts of heaters are kept clear
* There is a one-metre clearance to the routes of exit doors
* Displays where possible will not be above heaters, and if this is unavoidable they will be securely fixed

In the event of a fire
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Classroom times
```````````````

Escort all children from the building.
One member of staff does this, the other to check all areas of the class, take out the register and close windows and doors if possible.
Staff will take responsibility for their own children who may have special needs.
If a small group of children are in the garden or outdoor classroom engaged in focused work with an adult, they will exit through the security side gate.
If this route is cut off to them, they will exit by the gate to the front from the outdoor classroom and wait safely with their adult outside.

If you discover a fire, your first action must be to raise the alarm.
This involves setting off any alarm, and informing any staff members, in your vicinity.
When you are alarmed of a fire or when you hear the fire alarm,
you must immediately begin the evacuation procedure as follows, with respect to your own role(s) within it:

* If you are the *Fire Procedure Coordinator*, you must:

  #. collect the register and emergency contact cards
  #. evacuate all children you are aware of to the *Assembly Point* via the *Escape Route*.
  #. Call the fire brigade by dialling 999
  #. Take the register, finishing when all members of the *Fire Procedure Subordinate Team* have reached the *Assembly Point*

* If you are a member of the *Fire Procedure Subordinate Team*, you must:

  #. make final checks in *All Areas* to ensure that no child remains behind
  #. collect any found children to you
  #. when you have completed your search, evacuate the property with your children via the *Escape Route*

Then:

  #. Attempt to extinguish the fire with the nearest suitable *Fire Appliance*, unless the fire has reached such proportions as to endanger life or escape.
  #. Close all doors and windows.
  #. All staff and children will be accounted for whilst on the drive and then taken to an indoor point of safety at the hospital directly across Oxford Road.


After the event
```````````````

* Do not re-enter the building until advised to do so by the senior fire service officer. 
* If the fire has been extinguished by school staff do not disturb any evidence which could indicate the cause of the fire.
* Ensure that the premises are in safe working order before re-occupying.


Emergency evacuation procedure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every setting is different and the evacuation procedure will be suitable for each setting.
It must cover procedures for practice drills including:

* How children are familiar with the sound of the fire alarm.
* How the children staff and parents know where the fire exits are.
* How children are led from the building to the assembly point.
* How they will be accounted for and who by.
* How long it takes to get the children out safely.
* Who calls the emergency services and when in the event of a real fire.
* How parents are contacted.

The fire drill record book must contain:

* Date and time of the drill.
* How long it took.
* Whether there were any problems that delayed evacuation.
* Any further action taken to improve the drill procedure.
