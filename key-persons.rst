Policy

The Setting follows the concept of a 'Key Person'
as set out in the Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage.



Procedures

Documents
^^^^^^^^^



Key Person List
```````````````

A list of all children enrolled at The Setting,
with the following attributes,
ordered by surname:

* Name
* Date of birth
* Key Person
* Whether the Key Person is temporary



Assigning a Key Person
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the child begins their first day,
they shall be entered on the `Key Person List`_,
with the Key Person marked as *temporary*,
and chosen as the first result when potential Key Persons are ordered as follows:

* Order ascending by
  number of sessions in which
  the child would not have their Key Person present
* For any ties in the above scoring,
  order ascending by
  the number of Key Children that that potential Key Person already has assigned
  according to the `Key Person List`_.



Assigning permanent Key Persons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every two weeks,
the `Key Person List`_ will be run through,
and for each child with a Key Person with *temporary* status:

* *if staff decide that the child and Key Person have bonded*,
  on the grounds that the child:

  * looks for the Key Person when arriving
  * goes to the Key Person for comfort
 
  the Key Person status is remarked as *permanent*.
* *otherwise*,
  `a new Key Person is assigned`_.

.. _a new Key Person is assigned: `Assigning a Key Person`_



Reshuffling Key Persons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   **Why do we reshuffle Key Persons?**

   Over time,
   the weekly sessions taken by a child change,
   as do the weekly sessions worked by a staff member.
   This results in many sessions
   having Key Person assignment strongly skewed:
   for example, in session *A*,
   staff member *X* will have eight Key Children and staff member *Y* will have two,
   but in session *B*, *Y* may have eight, and *X*, two.
   The only solution to this is
   periodic reassignment to reflect the timetable.

At the end of every term,
the `Key Person List`_ is reshuffled.
