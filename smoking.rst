Policy
------

We comply with health and safety regulations and the Welfare Requirements of the EYFS.
Part of this compliance involves making our setting a no-smoking environment.
We apply this to our indoor and outdoor environments.

We have a policy that smoking be prohibited in all areas of the School unless otherwise designated.
The nursery is a no smoking area.
The nursery staff support this policy and will ensure that it is observed at all times.
This will apply to all staff, parents/carers, visitors and contractors entering the nursery building.
Staff will not be permitted to work in the nursery under the influence of drink or drugs.

Procedures
----------

* All staff, parents and volunteers are made aware of our no-smoking policy.
* We display no-smoking signs.
* The no-smoking policy is stated in our information brochure for parents.
* We actively encourage no-smoking by having information for parents and staff about where to get help to stop smoking if they are seeking this information.
* Staff who smoke do not do so during working hours.
  Unless on a break and off the premises.
* Staff who smoke during their break make every effort to reduce the effect of the odour and lingering effects of passive smoking for children and colleagues.
