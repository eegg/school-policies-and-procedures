Document purpose
----------------

Neither policies nor procedures are 'passive' documents.
They are not dusty lawbooks.
The reason for their existence is to provide useful information
for all parties to *The Setting*,
to be accessed at any stage of any predicament,
giving specific advice on how to handle the predicament.

From this reason for existence we can formulate some guidelines:

* terseness and clarity is preferable
  to duplication and fuzzy buzzwords.
  Where you feel you *might* be contradicting 'official' advice,
  give preference to sticking your neck out rather
  than being recoiling to fuzzy language.
* use plain English.
* model your procedures on a *flowchart*.


Policy structure
----------------

Each of our policies is divided into the following sections, in the following order:

+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Section                 | Contents                                                                            |
+=========================+=====================================================================================+
| **Definitions**         | Any terms, used principally in this policy,                                         |
|                         | that require further definition, for reasons of legality or clarity.                |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Policy**              | A prose section setting out the goals to achieve by setting out this policy.        |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Procedures**          | Specific, concrete instructions as to how all parties to *The Setting*              |
|                         |(*Team Members*, *Guardians* and *Children*) should act.                             |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Enforcement**         | How all parties are to be informed of the above Policies and Procedures.            |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **See also**            | Other sections of the Policies and Procedures that may be useful.                   |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Basis**               | Any documents that were the theoretical or legal foundation of the document,        |
|                         | or were referred to in the policy or which may be useful for further reading.       |
+-------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Style
-----

A few points to bear in mind for the consistency of style in this document:

* Do not end list elements with punctuation (commas, semi-colons, *etc.*)
* Do not end list elements with logical operators ('or', or 'and') unless necessary
* Do not use phrases like "staff should ...", or "we will endeavour that, where possible, ...".
  Instead state the ideal: "staff will ...".
* Use the active voice to avoid assigning duties: never "the emergency services are contacted ...";
  always "the *Illnesses and medication Officer* will contact the emergency services ..."


Phrases to avoid
----------------

* *LEA*, or *Local Educational Authority*.
  This phrase is now obsolete. [#lea]_
  Refer simply to the *Local Council*, or to the 
  *Director of Children's Services*.
