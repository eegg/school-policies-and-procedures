Policy
------

This setting believes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance.
We make our setting a safe and healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers by assessing and minimising the hazards and risks to enable the children to thrive in a healthy and safe environment.

The basis of this policy is risk assessment.


Procedures
----------

Our risk assessments follow five steps as follows:

* **Identification of risk.**
  Where is it and what is it? 
* **Who is at risk?**
  Childcare staff, children, parents, cooks, cleaners?
* **Risk level.**
  High, medium, low?
  This is both the risk of the likelihood of it happening, as well as the possible impact if it did.
* **Control measures.**
  What will you need to do, or ensure others will do, in order to reduce or eliminate that risk?
* **Monitoring and review.**
  How do you know if what you have said is working, or is thorough enough? If it is not working, it will need to be amended, or maybe there is a better solution.

Our risk assessment process covers adults and children and includes:

* checking for and noting hazards and risks indoors and outside, and in our premises and for activities;
* assessing the level of risk and who might be affected;
* deciding which areas need attention; and
* developing an action plan that specifies the action required, the time-scales for action, the person responsible for the action and any funding required.
* Where more than five staff and volunteers are employed the risk assessment is written and is reviewed regularly.
* We maintain lists of health and safety issues, which are checked daily before the session begins as well as those that are checked on a weekly and termly basis when a full risk assessment is carried out.
