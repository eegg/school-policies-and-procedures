If requests for admission exceed the number of places available you will be placed on a waiting list if a suitable place is not immediately available.
During your time on the waiting list you will be contacted from time to time to determine whether you are still interested in a place and also to give you some indication of when a place is likely to become available.

It is essential to the efficient running of the nursery and to other prospective parents/carers that you notify the nursery immediately should you make alternative childcare arrangements and no longer require a place.
Once the nursery is aware that a place is going to become available, the parents/carers at the top of the list with a child of the correct age for the vacancy will be offered that place.
Usually this will be some weeks or months in advance of the place becoming available.
On most occasions the place is accepted, when the place has been accepted a deposit of £115 must be paid to secure the child’s place but in instances where the place is not taken up and secured, it is offered to the next parent/carer on the list with a child of the appropriate age for the vacancy.


=== Procedures

Places are offered on the following basis:

* Priority is given to:
** those intending to use the nursery on a full-time basis.
** parents/carers who already have one child registered at the nursery.
* Parents/carers who take up part-time places are required to provide precise information of the days when they wish to bring their child to the nursery.
* Once a child has been allocated a place on an agreed basis, it is expected that parents/carers will adhere to these arrangements.
* Failure to do so may result in termination of the contract.


==== Termination of Registration

This may occur when:

* The child has reached the age limit.
* Failure to register for 5 days without contact or prior notification.
* If, despite best efforts, a child fails to settle, the contract may be terminated with immediate effect at the sole discretion of the Nursery Manager.
* Guardians wishing to terminate their registration must give four weeks notice in writing to the Nursery Manager
