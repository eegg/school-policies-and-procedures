The typical procedure for a guardian and child joining The Setting is as follows:

#. The client, and possibly others, `make a first visit`_ to The Setting together.
#. The Setting provides the guardian with an Enrolment Form to be completed.
#. The guardian returns the completed Enrolment Form.
#. The Setting checks the Enrolment Form is completed satisfactorily.
   If it is not, it is returned for completion.
#. The Setting provides the guardian with a Welcome Pack.
#. The child begins their first session not less than one working week after the return of the Enrolment Form.
#. The Setting produces an Initial Assessment of the child after the child has attended for two days.

.. _make a first visit: `The first visit`_


Making first contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For potential clients making first contact, The Setting

* advertises the following methods:

  * Telephone
  * Email

* does not advertise or recommend the following methods:

  * Unbooked visitation

In this initial conversation, the callee:

#. Establishes that the guardians and client understand what The Setting provides
#. Records, if the conversation continues to make it appropriate:

  * all fields in the `Prospective Clients Book`_
  * in the Setting Diary, a date and time for `a first visit`_

#. If requested,
   packages a Prospectus and other relevant information,
   addresses it according to the address recorded in the `Prospective Clients Book`_,
   and places it in the Setting Outbox.


The first visit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first visit should be attended by all of:

* the child if at all possible
* at least one guardian of the child
* the potential client

The visitors will be

* shown all of the property and site used by the children
* shown the equipment in the nursery
* briefed on The Setting's approach to education, if they are unfamiliar


We suggest that you do not spend time with your child in the setting.

Once a place has been offered, we aim to achieve this by inviting you and your child to visit the nursery prior to your child's official start date.
This helps to familiarise your child with the nursery, the nursery staff and the other children, and provides the opportunity to give your journey a trial run.
A child who is tense or unhappy will not be able to play or learn properly, so it is important for parents/carers and staff to work together to help the child feel confident and secure in the group.
This takes longer for some children and parents/carers should not feel worried if their child takes a while to settle.
You must be prepared to accept that it may take some time for your child to adjust to the nursery but very few children fail to settle eventually.
We find that staying with your child and then leaving him for short periods eases the separation process.
Please remember, the more your child comes and experiences the activities on offer and sees you interacting with the staff, the more settled he will feel.
To see our recommended programme to introduce your child to life at the nursery, please refer to the Settling-in Procedure in the Procedures section of this document.
In the unlikely event that your child does not seem to settle at the nursery we will review the situation with you and discuss the options, including termination of the contract.


Providing information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We ensure that our advertisements are accessible by all sections of the community.
* Information about our setting is produced in multiple forms when necessary:

  * in written and spoken form
  * in more than one language (and failing that, via an interpreter)
  * in Braille, or through British Sign Language


Waiting list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We arrange our waiting list in order of enrolment date.

(We arrange our waiting list in birth order.
  In addition our policy may take into account the following:

 * The vicinity of the home to the setting
 * Siblings already attending the setting)

(* We keep a place vacant, if this is financially viable, to accommodate an emergency admission.)


Satisfying needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We consult with families about the opening times of the setting to ensure we accommodate a broad range of family need.
* We are flexible about attendance patterns to accommodate the needs of individual children and families.
  This is providing these do not disrupt the pattern of continuity in the setting that provides stability for all the children.
