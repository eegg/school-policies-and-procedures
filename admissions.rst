Policy
------

The Setting should be accessible to children and families from all sections of the local community,
via fair and clearly communicated procedures.


We aim to ensure your child's introduction to our setting is as stress free as possible.
Once a place has been offered, we aim to achieve this by inviting you and your child to visit the nursery prior to your child's official start date.
This helps to familiarise your child with the nursery, the nursery staff and the other children, and provides the opportunity to give your journey a trial run.
A child who is tense or unhappy will not be able to play or learn properly, so it is important for parents/carers and staff to work together to help the child feel confident and secure in the group.
This takes longer for some children and parents/carers should not feel worried if their child takes a while to settle.
You must be prepared to accept that it may take some time for your child to adjust to the nursery but very few children fail to settle eventually.
We find that staying with your child and then leaving him for short periods eases the separation process.
Please remember, the more your child comes and experiences the activities on offer and sees you interacting with the staff, the more settled he will feel.
To see our recommended programme to introduce your child to life at the nursery, please refer to the Settling-in Procedure in the Procedures section of this document.
In the unlikely event that your child does not seem to settle at the nursery we will review the situation with you and discuss the options, including termination of the contract.
Such termination is at the sole discretion of the Nursery Manager.
