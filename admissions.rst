Enrolment and settling in
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The typical procedure for a guardian and child joining The Setting is as follows:

#. The guardian `makes first contact`_ with The Setting
#. The client, and possibly others, `make a first visit`_ to The Setting together
#. The client `returns a completed Enrolment Form`_
#. The child `begins their first session`_
#. The Setting produces an Initial Assessment of the child after the child has attended for two days.

.. _makes first contact: `Making first contact`_
.. _make a first visit: `The first visit`_
.. _returns a completed Enrolment Form: `Returning the Enrolment Form`_
.. _begins their first session: `The first day`_



Making first contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For potential clients making first contact, The Setting

* advertises the following methods:

  * Telephone
  * Email

* does not advertise or recommend the following methods:

  * Unbooked visitation

In this initial conversation, the callee:

#. Establishes that the guardians and client understand what The Setting provides
#. Records, if the conversation continues to make it appropriate

  * all fields in the `Prospective Clients Book`_
  * in the Setting Diary, a date and time for `a first visit`_

#. If requested,
   packages a Prospectus and other relevant information,
   addresses it according to the address recorded in the `Prospective Clients Book`_,
   and places it in the Setting Outbox.

.. _a first visit: `The first visit`_



The first visit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _a first visit has taken place:

.. container:: explanation
   
   **Why do we require a visit before enrolment?**

   Despite the many other ways of finding out about us --
   the web, email, a posted prospectus, telephone --
   there is, especially for a young child, no substitute for a physical visit.
   For both guardian and child, the visit should establish
   what the atmosphere is of a typical session at The Setting.

The first visit,
which shall take place during the time of a typical session at The Setting,
should be attended by

* the child if at all possible,
* at least one guardian of the child, and
* the potential client.

The visitors will be

* shown all of the property and site used by the children
* shown the equipment in the nursery
* briefed on The Setting's approach to education, if they are unfamiliar

If interest is shown,
The Setting provides the guardian with an Enrolment Form,
to be `returned when completed`_.

.. _returned when completed: `Returning the Enrolment Form`_



Returning the Enrolment Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Enrolment Form may be returned by:

* hand
* post

When the Enrolment Form is returned,
it is checked for completeness.
Completeness requires that:

* `a first visit has taken place`_
* all required fields of the Enrolment Form are completed
* all external documents referenced by the client,
  such as doctors' certificates, prescriptions, or Statements,
  are enclosed with the Enrolment Form

If the Enrolment Form is incomplete,
the client is informed that
they must pick up the Enrolment Form, complete it and resubmit it.

If the Enrolment Form is complete:

.. container:: explanation

   **Why the delay before the first session?**

   The Enrolment Form is a complex document.
   It will take time to transfer data from it to other appropriate records.
   There may be special considerations to take into account
   for that child (e.g. medical conditions) before they begin.
   There may be questions of legitimacy to consider before the child begins
   (e.g., credit checks on the client).

* it is filed
* the date of completion is noted in the `Setting Diary`_
* the `first session is arranged`_

.. _first session is arranged: `Allocating sessions and preparing for attendance`_



Allocating sessions and preparing for attendance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The requested sessions are checked against the timetable.

* **If the sessions are available**,
  `prepare for attendance`_.
* **If the sessions are not available**,
  the client is asked whether they wish to switch to a different pattern of sessions.
  
  * **If they choose to do so**, repeat.
  * **If they choose to stick with the pattern of sessions chosen**,
    the child is placed at the end of the `Waiting List`_
    if they are not yet on it.



Prepare for attendance
``````````````````````

When this stage is reached:

* provide the guardian with a `Welcome Pack`_.
* prepare all record-keeping for the child's first session
* the date of the child's first session is noted in the `Setting Diary`_,
  being not before one working week of the date of completion of the `Enrolment Form`_,
  as will have been noted in the `Setting Diary`_.



The first day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation
   
   **Why do we not recommend that the guardian stays with the child?**
    
   The child will settle quicker at nursery when
   it is made clear to her that her parents will not be present.
   Being present in the first few sessions
   only makes the settling process more prolonged,
   and thus more stressful for the child.

The child's first day should be as normal as possible.
The usual `Arrivals and Departures <arrivals-and-departures.html>`_ procedures should be followed
(including the prompt exit of the person dropping the child off).

During the first day:

* the child should be introduced to his peers by name



Changing sessional patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a client requests to change the number or pattern of sessions
that the child attends at The Setting:

* If the number of sessions has decreased,
  invoice for an *administration fee*.
* Go through the `Waiting List`_ in ascending order of date of enrolment.
  Contact each client,
  performing the procedures under `Allocating sessions and preparing for attendance`_.



The last day
^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a child leaves:

* Their documents are archived
* Go to `Changing sessional patterns`_



Termination of contract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Such termination is at the sole discretion of the Nursery Manager.
 
This may occur when: 
 
* The child has reached the age limit. 
* Failure to register for 5 days without contact or prior notification. 
* If, despite best efforts, a child fails to settle, the contract may be terminated with immediate effect at the sole discretion of the Nursery Manager. 
* Guardians wishing to terminate their registration must give four weeks notice in writing to the Nursery Manager
