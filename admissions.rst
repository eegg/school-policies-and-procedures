Prospective Clients Book
````````````````````````

A list of prospective clients, with the following attributes, ordered by date of contact:

* Date of first contact

Enrolment and settling in
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The typical procedure for a guardian and child joining The Setting is as follows:

#. The guardian `makes first contact`_ with The Setting
#. The client, and possibly others, `make a first visit`_ to The Setting together
#. The client `returns a completed Enrolment Form`_
#. The child `begins their first session`_
#. The Setting produces an Initial Assessment of the child after the child has attended for two days.

.. _makes first contact: `Making first contact`_
.. _make a first visit: `The first visit`_
.. _returns a completed Enrolment Form: `Returning the Enrolment Form`_
.. _begins their first session: `The first session`_


Making first contact
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For potential clients making first contact, The Setting

* advertises the following methods:

  * Telephone
  * Email

* does not advertise or recommend the following methods:

  * Unbooked visitation

In this initial conversation, the callee:

#. Establishes that the guardians and client understand what The Setting provides
#. Records, if the conversation continues to make it appropriate

  * all fields in the `Prospective Clients Book`_
  * in the Setting Diary, a date and time for `a first visit`_

#. If requested,
   packages a Prospectus and other relevant information,
   addresses it according to the address recorded in the `Prospective Clients Book`_,
   and places it in the Setting Outbox.

.. _a first visit: `The first visit`_



The first visit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first visit should be attended by all of:

* the child if at all possible
* at least one guardian of the child
* the potential client

The visitors will be

* shown all of the property and site used by the children
* shown the equipment in the nursery
* briefed on The Setting's approach to education, if they are unfamiliar

If interest is shown,
The Setting provides the guardian with an Enrolment Form,
to be `returned when completed`_.

.. _returned when completed: `Returning the Enrolment Form`_


Returning the Enrolment Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Enrolment Form may be returned by:

* hand
* post

When the Enrolment Form is returned,
it is checked for completeness.
Completeness requires that all external documents referenced by the client,
such as doctors' certificates, prescriptions, or Statements,
are enclosed with the Enrolment Form.

If the Enrolment Form is incomplete,
the client is informed that
they must pick up the Enrolment Form, complete it and resubmit it.

If the Enrolment Form is complete:

* it is filed
* the date of completion is noted in the Setting Diary.
* the date of the child's first session is noted in the Setting Diary,
  being not before one working week of the date of completion noted above.

Procedures are then executed ensuring that
all record-keeping is ready for the child's first session,
and The Setting provides the guardian with a Welcome Pack.


The first session
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation
   
   The child will settle quicker at nursery when
   it is made clear to her that her parents will not be present.
   Being present in the first few sessions
   only makes the settling process more prolonged,
   and thus more stressful for the child.

We suggest that you do not spend time with your child in the setting.

This helps to familiarise your child with the nursery, the nursery staff and the other children, and provides the opportunity to give your journey a trial run.
A child who is tense or unhappy will not be able to play or learn properly, so it is important for parents/carers and staff to work together to help the child feel confident and secure in the group.
This takes longer for some children and parents/carers should not feel worried if their child takes a while to settle.
You must be prepared to accept that it may take some time for your child to adjust to the nursery but very few children fail to settle eventually.
We find that staying with your child and then leaving him for short periods eases the separation process.
Please remember, the more your child comes and experiences the activities on offer and sees you interacting with the staff, the more settled he will feel.
To see our recommended programme to introduce your child to life at the nursery, please refer to the Settling-in Procedure in the Procedures section of this document.
In the unlikely event that your child does not seem to settle at the nursery we will review the situation with you and discuss the options, including termination of the contract.


Providing information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We ensure that our advertisements are accessible by all sections of the community.
* Information about our setting is produced in multiple forms when necessary:

  * in written and spoken form
  * in more than one language (and failing that, via an interpreter)
  * in Braille, or through British Sign Language


Waiting list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We arrange our waiting list in order of enrolment date.

(We arrange our waiting list in birth order.
  In addition our policy may take into account the following:

 * The vicinity of the home to the setting
 * Siblings already attending the setting)

(* We keep a place vacant, if this is financially viable, to accommodate an emergency admission.)


Satisfying needs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We consult with families about the opening times of the setting to ensure we accommodate a broad range of family need.
* We are flexible about attendance patterns to accommodate the needs of individual children and families.
  This is providing these do not disrupt the pattern of continuity in the setting that provides stability for all the children.


Termination of contract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Such termination is at the sole discretion of the Nursery Manager.
 
This may occur when: 
 
* The child has reached the age limit. 
* Failure to register for 5 days without contact or prior notification. 
* If, despite best efforts, a child fails to settle, the contract may be terminated with immediate effect at the sole discretion of the Nursery Manager. 
* Guardians wishing to terminate their registration must give four weeks notice in writing to the Nursery Manager
