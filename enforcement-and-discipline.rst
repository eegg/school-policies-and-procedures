Policy
------


Employees are treated with fairness and consistency.
Employees behave in a professional manner while at work.

Employees familiarise themselves with:

* the rules and procedures set out or referred to in their contracts of employment
* the specific working rules and procedures related to their particular areas of work
* such amendments as may be made, and drawn to their attention, from time to time

Discipline will abide by the `equal opportunities <equal-opportunities.html>`_ policy.
In accordance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, reasonable adjustments are made to cater for employees who have a disability.
An employee who believes this provision applies to them should notify the employers as soon as possible,
including suggested reasonable adjustments to be made to the procedure being followed.

All disciplinary correspondence, so far as possible, is typed.

This policy applies to:

* all employees of The Company
* all dismissals,
  and all disciplinary and unsatisfactory work performance complaints against an employee,
  including but not limited to:
   
  * dismissal for misconduct or gross misconduct
  * dismissal for lack of capability of absence from work
  * dismissal for redundancy (except in the case of multiple redundancies where the statutory collective consultation obligations apply)
  * dismissal for some other substantial reason
  * demotion for a conduct or capability issue
  * reallocation of duties following ill-health
  * dismissal on grounds of retirement, unless the retirement is by mutual consent
  * non-renewal of a limited term contract (also known as a fixed-term contract)


This policy does not apply to:

* minor infringements or issues can be resolved by informal discussion as part of the normal day-to-day management process


No disciplinary action will be taken against an employee
until the case has been fully investigated
and the facts of the case have been established by the appointed investigatory officer.

At every stage in the procedure
the employee will be told in writing of the complaint against them
and the basis of the complaint
and will be given an opportunity to state their case before decisions are reached.

Employees have the right at disciplinary hearings
to be accompanied by an appropriate trade union representative
or a work colleague.

An employee will not be dismissed for a first breach of discipline
except in the case of gross misconduct
where the penalty may be dismissal without notice or payment in lieu of notice.

Employees will be given a written explanation
for any disciplinary action taken
and told what improvement is expected and over what period of time.

An employee will have the right to appeal against any disciplinary penalty imposed.

The disciplinary procedure may be initiated at any stage,
and any disciplinary sanction may be bypassed
if an employee’s misconduct or work performance warrants such action.

Issues will be dealt with as thoroughly and promptly as possible.

Impartiality will be maintained by
all those involved in the disciplinary investigation and hearings.
A disciplinary hearing will not be concluded by
anyone who has been actively involved in the disciplinary investigation,
save in exceptional circumstances.



Procedures
----------


Minor misconduct or unsatisfactory performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


It is not always necessary to use formal disciplinary procedures
in cases of minor misconduct
or less serious cases of unsatisfactory performance.
These are usually best dealt with informally
between the employee’s line manager and employee.
For most cases of poor performance,
informal discussions, coaching, re-training and counselling
are considered a better option than formal disciplinary proceedings.

The purpose of taking informal action
is to provide an opportunity for improvement
or for the matter to be corrected
without the necessity for formal disciplinary procedures to be instituted.
In some cases this approach may identify a training need.

A note of the informal action taken,
including any informal warnings or cautions,
will be kept on the employee’s personal file.
However, they are there for background
and will not normally be taken into account
in the event of subsequent disciplinary procedures.



Formal disciplinary action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If informal action does not bring about an improvement,
or the misconduct or unsatisfactory performance
is considered to be too serious to be classed as minor,
formal disciplinary proceedings will be taken.

It is the responsibility of the employee’s line manager to
inform the HR Manager of the relevant circumstances
and follow the formal procedure set out below.



Preliminary or disciplinary investigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a potential disciplinary matter arises,
or when an employee’s standard of work performance is called into question,
a preliminary investigation will be carried out to establish the facts promptly.

The employee’s line manager will normally carry out this investigation.
On occasions another manager may be instructed to carry out the investigation,
for example if the matter is serious or if the employee’s line manager is unavailable.

The scope and extent of the preliminary investigation
will vary according to the seriousness of the individual complaint or matter.

The person who carries out the preliminary or disciplinary investigation
is called the Investigating Officer.

A preliminary investigation should take into account
the statements of any witnesses
and consideration will normally be given to the following matters
in so far as they are relevant to the case under investigation:

* what the alleged breach of discipline is, or the unsatisfactory work performance
* all surrounding circumstances
* the consequences of the breach or poor work performance
* the employee’s duties and job
* the employee’s experience and length of service
* the employee’s employment history and disciplinary record
* the evidence of witnesses
* any other evidence that can shed light on the situation
* any recent changes to the employee’s job or working environment
* any previous incidences that relate to the current one
* whether the employee has received appropriate counselling or training
* any mitigating circumstances, e.g. health or domestic problems, or provocation
* the effect (if any) on the welfare, including psychological welfare of the Service User

The preliminary investigation will normally include talking to the employee under investigation,
giving the employee a fair opportunity to answer questions and to state his or her case.



Suspension on full basic pay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In certain cases, for example:

* in cases involving alleged gross misconduct
* where relationships have broken down
* where there is a risk to the employers property
* responsibilities to other parties exist

consideration will be given to a period of suspension with full pay,
whilst unhindered investigations are conducted or pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing.
Any suspension will only be imposed after careful consideration
and will be periodically reviewed to ensure it is not unnecessarily protracted.

If the suspension relates to allegations of abuse towards a child,
then the procedure will be followed for notifying the relevant authorities.

Suspension is a precautionary measure.
Suspension should not be regarded as a disciplinary sanction.

Whilst suspended,
an employee’s contract of employment will continue
together with all their rights under the contract
including the payment of basic salary;
but during the period of suspension,
the employee will not be entitled to access any of the employers premises
or communicate with any other employee
except with the prior consent of the employers
and subject to such conditions as may be imposed.

All reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that
suspension does not preclude the employee’s ability to
gather and provide evidence in support of his or her case,
as appropriate.



Outcome and action
``````````````````

Once the preliminary or disciplinary investigation is completed,
having established the facts,
the Investigating Officer will decide whether to drop the matter,
deal with it informally,
or arrange for it to be handled formally.
Where the facts of a case appear to call for disciplinary action,
the Investigating Officer will,
in liaison with the Human Resources Department,
arrange for a disciplinary hearing in accordance with the following procedure set out below.



Formal disciplinary procedure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Step one: Statement of grounds and basis of action and invitation to disciplinary hearing
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Before any disciplinary hearing is held,
the Company shall give written notice to the employee,
which will:


* clearly set out the allegations or complaints against the employee,
  and the basis for those allegations or complaints
* invite the employee to a disciplinary hearing to discuss the matter
* provide the date, time and place of the disciplinary hearing
* state the names of any witnesses who may be called
* disclose copies of any documents to be considered at the hearing,
  including any prepared witness statements
  (but see paragraphs about cases involving witness confidentiality)
* offer the opportunity to be accompanied by
  a work colleague or appropriate trade union representative
  (see below)
* confirm the right to
  call witnesses
  and submit documentation in support of his or her case.

The above matters referred to can be provided to the employee
by a series of written communications,
provided that the disciplinary hearing does not take place
until all of the above information has been provided
in advance of the hearing;
and that the employee has had
a reasonable opportunity to consider his or her responses
to that information before the hearing commences.

The disciplinary hearing must be arranged
for a reasonable time
and in a convenient location.
If the employee or person accompanying them is disabled
this will be taken into account
and reasonable provision will be made so that they can participate fully.

The employee must take all reasonable steps to attend the disciplinary hearing.

If it was not reasonably practicable for
the Management representative or the employee
to attend the disciplinary hearing,
and the reason for the non-attendance was
not foreseeable when the hearing was arranged
(for example, if one of the parties was ill
or his/her car broke down on the way to the hearing)
a second disciplinary hearing will be rearranged to take place.
However, if the same occurs the second time around
(i.e. one party cannot attend for a reason which was not foreseeable
when the meeting was rearranged)
management will normally permit the rearranged hearing
to proceed in the employee’s absence,
but with the employee’s representative being provided with
an opportunity to present the employee’s case on his or her behalf.

Any written submission from the employee or their representative
will be considered at the disciplinary hearing.



Step two: Disciplinary hearing
``````````````````````````````

The disciplinary hearing must
take place before any penalty is imposed against the employee
(except in the case where the disciplinary action consists of suspension).

The person who chairs the disciplinary hearing will be,
so far as possible,
a manager who has not been involved in the preliminary or disciplinary investigation.
This person, at the hearing, will be called
the ‘Disciplinary Hearing Chairperson’ (or ‘Chairperson’).

A disciplinary hearing can be heard by one manager sitting alone,
or up to three managers sitting as a panel.

Whilst the exact format of each disciplinary hearing
will be dependent upon the allegations being made against the employee
and are subject to the absolute discretion of Management,
normally, however, the following will be addressed:

* The Chairperson will start the meeting by
  introducing all the people present
  and ensuring that everyone knows
  the background to and the purpose of the hearing.
* If possible,
  a fellow manager will attend the meeting
  who will take notes and discuss the hearing with the chairperson afterwards.
* The Investigating Officer will present the management’s case,
  including any witness evidence or documentary evidence.
* The employee must be given a full opportunity
  to comment on the allegations or complaints being made against them,
  to put forward any defence or arguments they want, and
  to comment on what disciplinary sanction, if any, is appropriate.
* The employee’s companion, if any,
  must also be permitted to participate at the hearing.
* At the end of the hearing
  the Chairperson will summarise what has happened
  and tell everyone what will happen next.
* The hearing will be adjourned so that the outcome can be considered.



Step three: Disciplinary hearing decision
`````````````````````````````````````````

After the disciplinary hearing,
the Chairperson (or the Panel)
will consider what action to take.
In cases where a reasonable belief in
the employee’s misconduct or unsatisfactory performance
is established on the balance of probabilities,
appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against the employee.

The employee will be notified of the disciplinary hearing’s decision,
and this written notification shall include the right to appeal against the decision,
if the employee is not satisfied with it.



Possible disciplinary outcomes and action
`````````````````````````````````````````

Following the disciplinary hearing
the Chairperson must decide whether
disciplinary action is justified or not.
Where it is decided that no action is justified
the employee will be informed in writing.

Where it is decided that disciplinary action is justified,
consideration will be given, before making any decision, to the employee’s

* disciplinary and general work record
* length of service
* actions taken in any previous similar cases against other employees
* the explanations given by the employee
* whether the intended disciplinary action is reasonable under the circumstances.



Stage one: First formal action – unsatisfactory performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Following the disciplinary hearing, an employee who is found to be performing unsatisfactorily will be given a written letter setting out:

* The performance problems
* The improvement that is required
* The time scale for achieving this improvement
* A review date
* Any support to be provided to assist the employee

The employee will be informed that
the letter represents the first stage of a formal procedure
and the failure to improve could lead to
a final written warning and, ultimately, dismissal.
A copy of the letter will be kept
and used as the basis for monitoring and reviewing future performance of the employee.

The employee will be reminded of this right to appeal.



Stage one: First formal action – misconduct
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where, following a disciplinary hearing,
an employee is found guilty of misconduct,
he will be given a written warning
setting out the nature of the misconduct
and the change in behaviour required.

The employee will be informed that
the warning is part of the formal disciplinary process
and the consequences will be of a failure to change behaviour.
The consequences will include
a final written warning
and ultimately dismissal.

The employee will be reminded of their right to appeal.



Stage two: Final written warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Where there is a failure to improve or change behaviour
in the time scale set out at the first formal stage,
or where the offence is sufficiently serious,
a final written warning will be issued to the employee,
but only after
they have been given a chance to present their case at a disciplinary hearing.
The final written warning will give
details of, and grounds for, the complaint.
It will warn that action under stage three (dismissal) will be considered
if there is no satisfactory improvement in performance or behaviour.

The employee will be reminded of their right to appeal.



Stage three: Dismissal or other penalty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If conduct or performance is still unsatisfactory
and the employee still fails to reach the prescribed standards,
dismissal will normally result.

The employee will be informed,
as soon as possible, of

* the reasons for the dismissal
* the date on which the employment will terminate
* the appropriate period of notice
* their right to appeal



Length of a disciplinary warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A warning will usually apply
in the case of a first formal action for 12 months,
after which time it will lapse;
and 24 months in respect of a final written warning.
However, there are occasions when the misconduct is so serious that
(although not warranting dismissal)
it cannot realistically be disregarded for future disciplinary purposes.
In such circumstances,
a final written warning can never be ignored
and any recurrence or any further misconduct is likely to lead to dismissal.



Step 4: Appeal
``````````````

Written confirmation of any disciplinary action
will confirm the employee’s right to appeal.
The employee should set out the grounds of his or her appeal in writing
within seven days of receiving notification of the disciplinary action to be taken.

At the appeal any disciplinary penalty imposed
will be reviewed but it cannot be increased.

The employee who chooses to appeal
should specify the grounds on which they are making the appeal.
For example, because

* they think a finding or penalty is unfair
* new evidence has come to light
* they think the disciplinary procedure was not used correctly


The employee will be invited to attend an appeal hearing.
This would be arranged for a reasonable time and in a convenient location.
If the employee or person accompanying them is disabled,
this will be taken into account
and reasonable provision will be made so that
they can participate fully.


The employee must take all reasonable steps to
attend the appeal meeting.

The appeal meeting need not take place
before the dismissal or disciplinary action takes effect.

The person who hears the appeal
should not have been involved in
the earlier stages of the disciplinary procedure.

After the appeal meeting,
the employee will be informed of the decision which will be final.
No further right of appeal exists.



Dismissals for gross misconduct
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gross misconduct is
misconduct of such a nature that
the attendance of the employee at the place of work
can no longer be justified.
These are examples of gross misconduct:

* Professional misconduct – contravention of professional codes of conduct
* Dishonesty, e.g. theft
* Fraud, including the falsification of business records (including time sheets or expense claims)
* Violent, abusive or intimidating conduct
* Sexual, racial or other harassment
* Serious insubordination
* Leaving work without authority
* Attending work under the influence of alcohol or non-medically prescribed drugs
* A criminal offence committed at work
  other than a minor road traffic offence committed in the course of employment,
  or an offence committed outside work which is
  incompatible with the employee remaining in employment
* Duplication or misuse of company owned or licensed software
* Serious breach of the employers health and safety policy
  and rules which endanger the health and safety of others
* Refusing to allow a security search
  to be carried out in accordance with the employers rules
* Falsification of information or references on appointment
* Unauthorised absence
* Acceptance of any bribe, secret profit or unauthorised commission
* Any conduct liable to bring the employers
  and/or the employee in his or her capacity as a representative of the employers
  into disrepute
* Serious negligence
  causing loss, damage or injury to
  the employers,
  its clients
  and/or any fellow employees
* Unauthorised disclosure of confidential business information or matters,
  made in breach of the Whistle Blowing Policy
* Deterring an employee from using
  the employers’ Whistle Blowing Policy
  or victimising the employee for so doing
* Concealment or destruction of
  evidence of any malpractice
  relating to the Company’s activities
  or that of an employee.


This list is neither exclusive nor exhaustive,
and in addition there may be other offences of a similar gravity
that would constitute gross misconduct.

For offences of suspected or alleged gross misconduct,
immediate suspension on full basic pay will normally apply
following full consideration of the gravity of the offence,
pending a preliminary investigation and a disciplinary hearing.
If the offence is established
and there are no acceptable mitigating circumstances,
dismissal will follow without notice or payment in lieu of notice.



Criminal offences outside employment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These will not be treated as automatic reasons for dismissal
regardless of whether the offence
has any relevance to the duties of the individual as an employee.
The main considerations will be
whether the offence is one that
makes the individual unsuitable for his or her type of work.

Police enquiries:

Where the conduct of an employee at work
is the subject of police enquiries or criminal charges,
the employee will normally be immediately suspended from duty.
A preliminary or disciplinary investigation would then be carried out
before a decision is taken on the outcome and action to be taken.

No action should be taken
which may prejudice the police enquiries or criminal proceedings.
Instructions from the police must be observed.
If there is any doubt about what action should be taken,
before or after the investigation stage,
the Investigating Officer should
seek guidance from the police
and the human resources department.



Trade union representatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normally, no disciplinary action should be taken against
a trade union representative
until the circumstances of the case have been
discussed with a full-time official of the union concerned.



Right to be accompanied
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Employees have the right to be
accompanied at any disciplinary hearing
by a single companion who is any of:

* a work colleague
* a full-time official employed by a trade union
* a lay official, so long as they have been certified in writing by their union
  as having experience of,
  or as having received training in,
  acting as an employee’s companion at disciplinary or grievance hearings.


The right to be accompanied
does not include the right to be represented by a solicitor or by a friend,
save in special circumstances.
For example,
if the employers were represented by a solicitor
it would be reasonable to permit the employee
to also be represented by a legally qualified person.

Employees must make a reasonable request to be accompanied.
The right to be accompanied arises
only if required or invited to attend certain disciplinary (or grievance) hearings.
Where an investigatory meeting is held solely to establish the facts of the case,
the right to be accompanied does not arise.

For the purposes of the right to be accompanied,
‘disciplinary hearings’ are defined as meetings that could result in any of:

* A formal warning being issued to an employee (i.e. a warning that will be placed on the employee’s record)
* The taking of some other disciplinary action (such as suspension without pay, demotion or dismissal) or other action
* The confirmation of a warning or some other disciplinary action (such as an appeal hearing)

Informal discussions or counselling sessions
do not attract the right to be accompanied
unless they could result in formal warnings or other actions.
Meetings to investigate an issue are not disciplinary hearings.
If it becomes clear during the course of such a meeting
that disciplinary action is called for,
the meeting should be ended
and at subsequent investigatory meetings
or at the disciplinary hearing
the employee has the right to be accompanied.


It is the employee’s responsibility
to organise the attendance of their companion and any relevant witnesses.

Employees must make a reasonable request to management to be accompanied.
This request should be confirmed in writing.



What is a reasonable request?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Whether a request for a companion is reasonable
will depend on the circumstances of each individual case.
In considering a request to be accompanied,
consideration will be given to
whether it would be reasonable to prevent an employee
to be accompanied by a colleague
whose presence would prejudice the hearing
or who might have a conflict of interest.
Nor would it be reasonable for
an employee to ask to be accompanied by
a colleague from a geographically remote location
when someone suitably qualified was available locally.

Fellow employees or trade union officials
do not have to accept a request to accompany an employee,
and they should not be pressurised to do so.

Any employee who has agreed to accompany a colleague
is entitled to take a reasonable amount of paid time off
to fulfil that responsibility.
This will cover the hearing
and to allow time for the companion to familiarise themselves with the case
and confer with the employee before and after the hearing.

Where possible a companion
will be allowed to have a say in
the date and time of a hearing.
If the companion cannot attend on a proposed date,
the employee can suggest an alternative time and date
so long as it is reasonable
and it is not more than five working days after the original date.
A longer postponement may be allowed at management’s discretion.

The companion is allowed to address the hearing in order to:
 
* put and explain the employee’s case
* sum up the employee’s case
* respond on the employee’s behalf to any view expressed at the hearing

The companion can also confer with the employee during the hearing.
The companion is allowed to participate
as fully as reasonably possible in the hearing,
including asking witnesses questions.
There is not, however,
an automatic right to cross-examine witnesses.
The companion has no right to

* answer questions on the employee’s behalf
* address the hearing if the employee does not wish it
* permit the employer from explaining their case



Witness confidentiality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The employers reserve the right
to withhold witness names and/or witness statements
in cases where it is reasonable to maintain witness confidentiality.
This need may arise in serious cases (e.g. gross misconduct)
where a witness reasonably requests that he or she remains anonymous,
or where confidentiality has reasonably been promised to a witness.
In such cases statements may be
disclosed in an anonymous or redacted (concealed) form
to protect the witness identity.

In all cases,
disclosed witness statements
and supporting documentation
must be kept confidential
and shall only be used for
purposes relating to the disciplinary procedure.



Keeping disciplinary records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Written records of each disciplinary process will be kept by the employer.
These records may include:

* the complaint against the employee
* the employee’s defence
* findings made and actions taken
* the reasons for actions taken
* whether an appeal was lodged
* the outcome of the appeal
* any grievances raised during the disciplinary procedures
* subsequent developments

The employers shall regard records as confidential
and will be kept no longer than necessary
in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

Copies of meeting or disciplinary hearing records
will normally be given to the employee
including copies of any formal minutes that may have been taken.
The employers, in certain circumstances, however, (for example to protect a witness)
might withhold some information.
