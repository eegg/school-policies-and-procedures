   Confidential information
     Information of some sensitivity,
     which is not already lawfully in the public domain or readily available from another public source,
     and which has been shared in a relationship where the person giving the information understood it would not be shared with others. [#confidential-information-definition]_



Our *Staff* can be said to have a 'confidential relationship' with families.
We respect the privacy of children and their guardians.
We aim to ensure that all parents and carers can share their information in the confidence that it will only be used to enhance the welfare of their children.

Our work will bring us into contact with confidential information.
To ensure that all those using and working in the nursery can do so with confidence, we will respect confidentiality in the following ways: 

#. Parents/carers will have ready access to files and records of their own children - but not any other child.
#. Staff will not discuss individual children with people other than the parents/carers of that child.
#. Information given by parents/carers to nursery staff will not be passed on to third parties.
#. Personnel issues will remain confidential to the people involved.
#. Any anxieties/evidence relating to a child's personal safety will be kept in a confidential file and will not be shared within the nursery except for the child's key worker and Manager.
#. The nursery will comply with all requirements of the Data Protection Act.


  Ensuring that children and young people are kept safe and receive the best support they need when they need it is vital.
  Where information sharing is necessary to achieve this objective it is important that the practitioners have a clear understanding of when information can be shared.
  It is also for them to understand the circumstances of when sharing is inappropriate.
  The Data Protection Act is not a barrier to sharing information but is in place to ensure that personal information is shared appropriately.
  
  -- Richard Thomas (Information Commissioner), Introduction to *Information Sharing: Practitioners’ Guide* (HMG 2006)

We recognise that parents have a right to know that information they share will be regarded as confidential as well as be informed about the circumstances, and reasons, when we are obliged to share information.

We are obliged to share confidential information without authorisation from the person who provided it or to whom it relates if it is in the public interest. That is when:

* it is to prevent a crime from being committed or intervene where one may have been or to prevent harm to a child or adult; or
* not sharing it could be worse than the outcome of having shared it.

The decision should never be made as an individual, but with the back-up of management committee officers.
The three critical criteria are:

* Where there is *evidence* that the child is suffering, or is at risk of suffering, significant harm
* Where there *is reasonable cause to believe* that a child may be suffering or at risk of suffering significant harm
* To *prevent* significant harm arising to children and young people or serious harm to adults, including the prevention, detection and prosecution of serious crime



Procedures
----------

* We always check whether parents regard the information they share with us to be regarded as confidential or not.
* Some parents sometimes share information about themselves with other parents as well as staff.
  The setting cannot be held responsible if information is shared beyond those parents whom the person has ‘confided’ in.
* Information shared between parents in a discussion or training group is usually bound by a shared agreement that the information is confidential to the group and not discussed outside of it.
* We inform parents when we need to record confidential information beyond the general personal information we keep, such as with regard to:

 * injuries
 * concerns or changes in relation to the child or the family
 * discussions with parents on sensitive matters
 * records we are obliged to keep regarding action taken in respect of child protection
 * contact and correspondence with external agencies in relation to their child

Our procedure is based on the *6 points for Good Practice* as set out in *Information Sharing: Practitioners’ Guide* (HMG 2006).

* Explain to families how, when and why information will be shared about them and with whom:
  That consent is normally obtained, unless it puts the child at risk or undermines a criminal investigation.

 * We ensure parents receive information about our information sharing policy when starting their child in the centre.
   We ensure they sign a form to say that they understand circumstances when information may be shared without their consent.
   This will only be when it is a matter of safeguarding a child or vulnerable adult.
 * We ensure parents have information about our Safeguarding Children and Child Protection policy.
 * We ensure parents have information about the circumstances when information will be shared with external agencies
   ,for example, with regard to any special needs the child may have or transition to school.
 
* Consider the safety and welfare of the child when making a decision about sharing information --
  if there are concerns regarding ‘significant harm’ the child’s well being and safety is paramount.

 * We record concerns and discuss these with the *Designated Person* for child protection matters.
   Record decisions made and the reasons why information will be shared and to whom.
 * We follow the procedures for reporting concerns and record keeping.

* Respect the wishes of children and parents not to consent to share confidential information.
  However, in the interests of the child, we are able to judge when it is reasonable to override their wish.

 * Guidelines for consent are part of this procedure.
 * Managers are conversant with this and are able to advise staff accordingly.

* Seek advice when there are doubts about possible significant harm to a child or others.

 * Managers contact children’s social care for advice where they have doubts or are unsure.

* Information shared should be accurate and up-to-date, necessary for the purpose it is being shared for and shared only with those who need to know and shared securely.

 * Our Safeguarding Children and Child Protection procedure and record keeping procedures set out how and where information should be recorded and what information should be shared with another agency when making a referral.

* Reasons for decisions to share information, or not, are recorded.

 * Provision for this is set out in our record keeping procedure.



Client access to records
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parents may request access to any confidential records held on their child and family following the procedure below:

* Any request to see the child’s personal file by a parent or person with parental responsibility must be made in writing to the setting leader or manager.
* The setting leader informs the chairperson of the management committee and sends a written acknowledgement.
* The setting commits to providing access within 14 days, although this may be extended.
* The setting’s leader or manager and chairperson of the management committee prepare the file for viewing.
* All third parties are written to, stating that a request for disclosure has been received and asking for their permission to disclose to the person requesting it.
  Copies of these letters are retained on file.
* ‘Third parties’ include all family members who may be referred to in the records.
* It also includes workers from any other agency, including social services, the health authority, etc.
  It is usual for agencies to refuse consent to disclose, preferring the individual to go directly to them.
* When all the consents/refusals to disclose have been received these are attached to the copy of the request letter.
* A photocopy of the complete file is taken.
* The setting leader and chairperson of the management committee go through the file and remove any information which a third party has refused consent to disclose.
  This is best done with a thick black marker, to score through every reference to the third party and information they have added to the file.
* What remains is the information recorded by the setting, detailing the work initiated and followed by them in relation to confidential matters.
  This is called the ‘clean copy’.
* The ‘clean copy’ is photocopied for the parents who are then invited in to discuss the contents.
  The file should never be given straight over, but should be gone through by the setting leader, so that it can be explained.
* Legal advice may be sought before sharing a file, especially where the parent has possible grounds for litigation against the setting or another (third party) agency.
  All the undertakings above are subject to the paramount commitment of the setting, which is to the safety and well-being of the child.
  Please see also our policy on child protection.


Consent
^^^^^^^

Parents have a right to be informed that their consent to share information will be sought in most cases, as well as the kinds of circumstances when their consent may not be sought, or their refusal to give consent overridden.

* Our policies and procedures set out our responsibility regarding gaining consent to share information and when it may not be sought or overridden.
* We may cover this verbally when the child starts or include this in our prospectus.
* Parents sign a form at registration to say they understand this.
* Copies are given to parents of the forms they sign.
* Parents are asked to give written consent to share information about any additional needs their child may have, or to pass on child development summaries to the next provider/school.
* We consider the following questions:

 * Is there legitimate purpose to sharing the information?
 * Does the information enable the person to be identified?
 * Is the information confidential?
 * If the information is confidential, do you have consent to share?
 * Is there a statutory duty or court order to share information?
 * If consent is refused, or there are good reasons not to seek consent, is there sufficient public interest to share information?
 * If the decision is to share, are you sharing the right information in the right way?
 * Have you properly recorded your decision?

All the undertakings above are subject to the paramount commitment of the setting, which is to the safety and well-being of the child.
Please also see our Safeguarding Children and Child Protection policy.
