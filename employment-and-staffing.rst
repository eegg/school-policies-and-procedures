Policy
------

We provide a staffing ratio in line with the Welfare requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage to ensure that children have sufficient individual attention and to guarantee care and education of a high quality.
Our staff are appropriately qualified and we carry out checks for criminal and other records through the Criminal Records Bureau in accordance with statutory requirements.

* We work towards offering equality of opportunity by using non-discriminatory procedures for staff recruitment and selection.
* All staff have job descriptions which set out their staff roles and responsibilities.

* Suitability does not consider:

 * marital status
 * age
 * gender
 * culture
 * religious belief
 * ethnic origin
 * sexual orientation

* Applicants will not be placed at a disadvantage by our imposing conditions or requirements that are not justifiable.
* We use Ofsted guidance on obtaining references and enhanced criminal record checks through the Criminal Records Bureau for staff and volunteers who will have unsupervised access to children.
* We keep all records relating to employment of staff and volunteers, in particular those demonstrating that checks have been done, including the date and number of the enhanced CRB check.

Managing staff absences and contingency plans for emergencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* In term time only settings, our staff take their holiday breaks when the setting is closed.
  Where staff may need to take time off for any reason other than sick leave or training, this is agreed with the manager with sufficient notice.
* In all year round settings, managers organise staff annual leave so that ratios are not compromised.
* Where staff are unwell and take sick leave in accordance with their contract of employment, we organise cover to ensure ratios are maintained.
