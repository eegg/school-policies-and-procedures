Policy
------

We respect the fact that children:

* have different educational and behavioural needs and aspirations
* require different strategies for learning
* acquire, assimilate and communicate information at different rates
* need a range of different teaching approaches and experiences

DIFFERENTIATION!


Procedures
----------



Staff respond to children’s needs by:

* providing support for children who need help with communication, language and literacy
* planning to develop children’s understanding through the use of all available senses and experiences
* planning for children’s full participation in learning, and in physical and practical activities
* helping children to manage their behaviour and to take part in learning effectively and safely
* helping individuals to manage their emotions, particularly trauma or stress, and to take part in learning

‘different from’ or ‘additional to’ those provided as part of the nursery’s usual working practices.

Wherever possible we do not withdraw children from the nursery situation. There are times, though, when to maximise learning, we ask the children to work in small groups, or in a one-to-one situation outside the main learning environment.
