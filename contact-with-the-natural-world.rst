Policy
------

We want our children to learn about the natural world.
Where possible, we facilitate this by contact with such,
whether through trips, visits or as pets.
This is done in accordance with hygiene and safety controls.
Our pets have appropriately fulfilling and healthy lives.



Procedures
----------


Risk assessing contact with organisms
`````````````````````````````````````

For all organisms that will deliberately be introduced to children or staff,
we carry out a risk assessment (see `Managing Risk <managing-risk.html>`_).
A person knowledgeable in the species
and its demands, behaviour, and `risks`_,
must have input in this.
This person may be the owner of the organism.
The risk assessment must cover:

* hygiene or safety risks,
  where necessary stipulating that

  * children wash their hands after contact


  * correct handling of the organism,
    and how this will be taught to children and staff

.. _risks: `Risks posed by organisms`_
