Policy
------

The Setting follows the concept of a 'Key Person'
as set out in the Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage.



Procedures
----------


Assigning a Key Person
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the child begins their first day,
they shall be entered on the `Key Person List`_.
Their Key Person is chosen to minimise the number of sessions in which
the child will not have their Key Person present.

The child's Key Person is subject to change within the first 7 weeks,
depending on the attachments formed by the child.


Reshuffling Key Persons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   **Why do we reshuffle Key Persons?**

   Over time,
   the weekly sessions taken by a child may change,
   as do the weekly sessions worked by a staff member.
   This results in many sessions
   having Key Person assignment strongly skewed:
   for example, in session *A*,
   staff member *X* will have eight Key Children and staff member *Y* will have two,
   but in session *B*, *Y* may have eight, and *X*, two.
   The only solution to this is
   periodic reassignment to reflect the timetable.

At the end of every term,
the `Key Person List`_ may be reshuffled.


The role of a Key Person
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The role of the Key Person of child C is to

* pass on information to C's parents, such as a summary of C's week at nursery
