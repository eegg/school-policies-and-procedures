Policy
------

The Setting follows the concept of a 'Key Person'
as set out in the Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage.



Procedures
----------



Assigning a Key Person
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before the child begins their first day,
they shall be entered on the `Key Person List`_,
with the Key Person marked as *temporary*,
and chosen as the first result when potential Key Persons are ordered as follows:

* Order ascending by
  number of sessions in which
  the child would not have their Key Person present
* Key persons are assigned on a temporay basis for the first 6-7 weeks that the child attends.  After this period the key person is subject to change and is dependent upon the bonds and attachements formed by the child and staff to child ratios.    







Reshuffling Key Persons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   **Why do we reshuffle Key Persons?**

   Over time,
   the weekly sessions taken by a child may change,
   as do the weekly sessions worked by a staff member.
   This results in many sessions
   having Key Person assignment strongly skewed:
   for example, in session *A*,
   staff member *X* will have eight Key Children and staff member *Y* will have two,
   but in session *B*, *Y* may have eight, and *X*, two.
   The only solution to this is
   periodic reassignment to reflect the timetable.

At the end of every term,
the `Key Person List` may be reshuffled.
