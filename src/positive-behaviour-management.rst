Bullying
  Long-term *Abuse*
  of a particular individual or group
  by another individual or group,
  characterised by:
  
  * premeditation
  * awareness of impact


Inappropriate Behaviour
  Any of:
  
  * *Abuse*
  * *Bullying*
  * Disrespecting the
    views,
    feelings,
    needs, or
    rights
    of others

Physical Restraint
  Physical contact with another person,
  designed to restrain them from exercising their will.
  This excludes any action that is aggressive, harmful, or invasive.


Policy
------

We maintain a code of behaviour.
This code is as culture-neutral as possible,
and we strive to recognise when it is in conflict with cultural codes.

We enforce our code of behaviour by:

* example
* encouragement of good behaviour
* discouragement of inappropriate behaviour
* instruction

We do not enforce our code of behaviour by:

* punitive exclusion
* labelling of the child
* physical punishment
* humilation
* forcing apologies

We reduce the urge to inappropriate behaviour, by:

* providing for personal, social and emotional needs
* recognising the root causes, and stemming them

We do not categorise children but behaviours as inappropriate or as 'bullying',
and as such children may:

* have multiple inappropriate behaviours
* be simultaneously a recipient and a giver of inappropriate behaviour

We recognise that children of different ages
will respond most successfully
to different strategies of enforcement.

There may be times when *Team Members*,
in the course of their duties,
have to intervene physically in order to
restrain children and prevent them from coming to harm.
This use of *Physical Restraint* will:

* be reduced to a minimum
* prioritize the safety of pupils and staff
* be the minimum necessary to resolve the situation
* be fully documented
* where appropriate, be reported

`Fantasy aggression`_ does not constitute inconsiderate behaviour,
is acceptable within limits,
and offers opportunities to explore concepts of right and wrong.
This distinction can, however,
be difficult.
We ensure that
children and *Team Members*
understand the distinction
and
can make the distinction in an 'incident' in which they are not involved.


Procedures
----------


Designing the classroom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When designing the classroom:

  * 'calmness' will be the foremost design decision
  * adequate space and equipment should be given per child


Educating minimization of conflict
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Team Members* :

  * use Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) approaches
    to teach pupils how to manage conflict and strong feelings.
  * help children recognise their feelings by naming them,
    making a connection verbally between the event and the feeling.
  * provide a positive model of behaviour.
  * do not create situations in which
    children receive adult attention only in return for inconsiderate behaviour
  * ensure children feel a sense of belonging
  * encourage children to wait turns or share where equipment is in short supply
  * develop the moral principles of good behaviour
    through activities, drama and stories.
  * give children opportunities to practise and reflect on good behaviour

The *Key Person* :

* Provides a relationship
  between the child and *The Setting*


On the lookout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Team Members* should constantly be assessing
the level of risk of *Abuse*
in their vicinity
(respecting guidelines under `Fantasy aggression`_).
Based on the assessment:

* If the risk is immediate,
  go to `Using Physical Restraint`_.
* If the risk is significant, but not immediate,
   go to `Defusing situations`_.


Using Physical Restraint
````````````````````````

1. Are you a *Staff Member*?

   * **Yes**: go to 2.
   * **No**: are any staff members present?
   
     * **Yes**: go to 4.
     * **No**: go to 2.
   
2. Consecutively go through all the following types of *Physical Restraint*.
   Assess, using the guidelines in `Risk-assessing Physical Restraint`_,
   whether the risk in using it is lower than the risk in not using it.
   Use the first one that is lower and which has not yet been used.
   
   (a) Physically separate, by blocking paths, the abuser and abused.
   (#) Lead the abuser (by the hand, shoulder, or arm) away from the scene.
   (#) Use a more restrictive hold,
       if appropriately trained.

3. Is the situation defused?

   * **Yes**: go to 5.
   * **No**: Have all possible types of *Physical Restraint* been used?
     
     * **No**: go to 2.
     * **Yes**: go to 4.

4. Contact someone else.
   Use the following contact methods in order of preference:

   (a) Alert a *Staff Member* in line-of-sight.
   (#) Alert a *Staff Member* via internal communications systems.
   (#) Use judgement to exit the area and return with someone
       authorised to use *Physical Restraint*.
   (#) Alert *The Police*, giving the following information:
     
       * The location of *The Setting*
       * Who is involved in the incident

5. Go to `Post-incident procedures`_.


Defusing situations
```````````````````

#. Go to the area of activity.
#. If the potential abuser is pre-literate,
   attempt using distraction,
   and failing that,
   go to `Using Physical Restraint`_.
#. If the situation is defused, stop.
#. If any child in the vicinity the immediate subject of *Abuse*,
   go to `Using Physical Restraint`_.
#. Try a new tack each time this step is reached:

   (a) Instruct the potential abuser to calm down.
   (#) Instruct the potential abuser and abused to separate and go to separate places.
   (#) Give a clear oral warning to the possible Abuser that they may have to be restrained.
   (#) Tell the potential abuser the type of *Physical Restraint* that may be used.
   (#) Go to `Using Physical Restraint`_.

#. Go to 3.



Risk-assessing Physical Restraint
`````````````````````````````````

The use of *Physical Restraint* always involves a risk assessment.
More precisely, it is composed of two risk assessments:
the risk of intervention,
and the risk of not intervening.
This is simultanously a decision procedure for deciding whether to use *Physical Restraint*:
compare the level of risk for each possible action.
Given the immediate nature of the situations in which *Physical Restraint* is necessary,
these must always be a mental assessment.
Both are assessed on the following principles:

* The level of risk is directly proportional to the level of harm.
* The level of harm is simply a summation of 'expected' harm to all parties:

  * the abuser(s),
  * the abused,
  * the intervener(s).

* The expected harm to each party is a summation of:

  * Expected physical harm
  * Expected psychological harm


Post-incident procedures
````````````````````````

#. Comfort any intense emotions in an age-appropriate way:
   
   * Especially young children: through holding and cuddling
   * Verbal children: offer them an explanation

#. Spend time with the parties to the incident.
   Discuss:

   * why the incident arose
   * why the behaviour,
     of possibly both parties,
     was unacceptable:
     help develop empathy
     by asking children to
     imagine themselves in
     the position of another
   * what behaviour would have instead been appropriate
   * whether any apologies want to be made

#. Use an *Incident Form* to record the incident,
   including the post-incident discussion above.
#. Risk assess,
   using a *Risk Assessment Form*,
   the presence of the abuser in *The Setting*.
#. Based on the Risk Assessment,
   assess whether it is appropriate to contact the following:

   * Childrenâ€™s Safeguarding Board
   * Health and Safety Executive
   * youth offending teams
   * The Police

#. Based on the *Incident Form*,
   assess whether it is appropriate to
   arrange help from external bodies such as:
   
   * an Inclusion Officer
   * a Health Visitor
   * a General Practitioner
   * a Behaviour Support Team
   
   in order to:
   
   * Rebuild relationships between abuser and abused
   * Support the abused

#. Arrange a separate meeting for each child involved,
   including:
   
   * the guardians of the child
   * the *Key Person* of the child
   * all *Team Members* involved
   
   in order to:
   
   * discuss the findings in
     the *Incident Form*
     and
     the *Risk Assessment*
   * find whether similar incidents
     are happening outside of *The Setting*
   * gain permission to
     contact any appropriate external bodies
   * produce a strategy
     for dealing with inappropriate behaviour
   * gain support for
     any removal of children
     from *The Setting*

#. Based on the *Incident Form*,
   the involved children's history and circumstances,
   the table at `Finding the cause of inappropriate behaviour`_,
   and the input of guardians in the above meeting,
   produce an Action Plan
   for avoiding recurrent incidents.


Fantasy aggression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Play often has aggressive themes.
It may be difficult for non-participants to
distinguish fantasy aggression from *Abuse*.
Note that fantasy aggression:

* never involves actual bodily harm
* is always consensual


Finding the cause of inappropriate behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inappropriate behaviour has many possible causes,
which may be present simultaneously.
Often,
you will be able to
identify the causes by
simply asking and listening.
However,
if you suspect the whole truth has not been revealed,
or the child is pre-verbal,
the following table gives guidance on
how to identify the cause of the behaviour
and
ways in which you might deal with it
(in addition to all other advice herein):

|                   | can get the desired response.               |                                         |                                           |
