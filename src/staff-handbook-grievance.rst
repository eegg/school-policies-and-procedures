Policy
------

1. This procedure applies to all employees, regardless of job or grade, employed by the employers or who work at a home or centre owned or operated by the employers. Its aim is to resolve individual grievances fairly, consistently and speedily.
2. The employers recognise that misunderstandings or grievances may sometimes occur. It is most important that these grievances are brought out into the open and resolved as quickly and fairly as possible.
3. In most cases this can be done on an informal basis between the employee and the employee’s line manager, who in most cases should be best placed to successfully deal with the issue.
4. However there are occasions when a more formal approach may be needed. This grievance procedure is designed to ensure that an employee’s grievance is addressed, and if possible, successfully resolved.
5. When following this procedure the employers will not seek to discriminate against any employee. When appropriate under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, The employers will make reasonable adjustments to cater for an individual who has a disability. An employee who believes this provision applies to them, should notify the employers as soon as possible giving full details, including suggested reasonable adjustments to be made to the procedure being followed.
6. All grievance documentation, so far as possible, must be typed.
7. This procedure is not intended to be a contractual term and condition of employment with the employers.

5. This grievance procedure incorporates the procedural requirements of the statutory grievance procedures as set out in Schedule 2 Employment Act 2002 and the Employment Act 2002 (Dispute Resolution) Regulations 2004.
6.

Grievance procedure
-------------------



Stage 1: Informal discussions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. The employee should discuss the matter informally with their immediate line manager.


2. If the grievance is about the employee’s line manager, the matter may be referred to that person’s manager or another more senior manager.


3. The manager will try and resolve the matter to the employee’s satisfaction.


4. If the employee, for any reason, does not consider it appropriate to try and resolve their grievance informally or if the employee is not satisfied with the manager’s reply, the employee must proceed with Stage 2.



Stage 2: Submission of written statement of grievance and meeting
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


1. The employee must write to their line manager setting out their grievance in full, providing copies of any relevant documents. This statement must clearly explain the basis of the grievance.


2. Management may carry out such enquiries as considered reasonable in order to fairly resolve the grievance. It may be necessary for management to make enquiries with other people about the grievance. As part of these enquiries it may be necessary to have more than one meeting with the employee to discuss their grievance with them.


3. Once management has had a reasonable opportunity to consider its response to the employee’s grievance, management will invite the employee to attend a meeting to discuss the grievance. This meeting will not take place unless the employee has informed management of the basis for their grievance, if this was not originally included in the employee’s written grievance letter/statement required under paragraph 3.10.3.2 above.


4. The employee must take all reasonable steps to attend the meeting.


5. After the meeting, management will write to the employee confirming the outcome of the grievance. This letter will include a reminder of the employee’s right to appeal, if the employee is not satisfied with the outcome.



Stage 3: Appeal to the Operations Director
------------------------------------------

1. If the employee decides to appeal, they must write to the Operations Director within five days of receiving the Stage 2 decision. The appeal letter should set out the reasons for the employee’s appeal.


2. If the grievance is against the Operations Director, the matter will be referred to a different manager of the same or greater seniority to deal with.


3. The employee will be invited to attend an appeal meeting with the Operations Director when the employee’s grievance and their reasons for appealing will be discussed further.


4. The employee must take all reasonable steps to attend the meeting.

Grievances after termination of employment

2. Management will if possible discuss with the ex-employee which option is preferred at the time.



Right to be accompanied at all grievance meetings
-------------------------------------------------


1. Employees have the right to be accompanied at any grievance meeting by a single companion who is either a:


2. 

1. work colleague; or


2. full-time official employed by a trade union; or


3. lay official, so long as they have been certified in writing by their union as having experience of, or as having received training in, acting as an employee’s companion at disciplinary or grievance hearings.




3. The right to be accompanied does not include the right to be represented by a solicitor or by a friend, save in special circumstances. For example, if management were represented by a solicitor it would be reasonable to permit the employee to also be represented by a legally qualified person.


4. The companion has the right to explain and to sum up the employee’s case, and to respond to any views expressed at the meeting/hearing. The companion may not answer questions on the employee’s behalf.


5. If the Employee or the employee’s companion cannot attend on the date management has set for the meeting, management will always postpone the meeting for up to five days and may, at management’s discretion, postpone it for a longer period of time.


6. It is the employee’s responsibility to organise the attendance of their companion and any relevant witnesses.


7. Employees must make a reasonable request to management to be accompanied. This request should be confirmed in writing.



What is a reasonable request?
-----------------------------


1. Whether a request for a companion is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of each individual case. In considering a request to be accompanied, management will consider that it would not be reasonable to allow an employee to be accompanied by a colleague whose presence would prejudice the meeting or who might have a conflict of interest. Nor would it be reasonable for an employee to ask to be accompanied by a colleague from a geographically remote location when someone suitably qualified was available locally.


2. Fellow employees or trade union officials do not have to accept a request to accompany an employee, and they should not be pressurised to do so.


3. Any employee who has agreed to accompany a work colleague is entitled to take a reasonable amount of paid time off to fulfil that responsibility. This will cover the meeting and to allow time for the companion to familiarise themselves with the grievance details and confer with the employee before and after the meeting.


4. Where possible, management will allow a companion to have a say in the date and time of a meeting. If the companion cannot attend on a proposed date, the employee can suggest an alternative time and date so long as it is reasonable and it is not more than five working days after the original date. Management will at its discretion agree to postpone for a longer period of time.


5. The companion is allowed to address the hearing in order to:-


6. 

1. put and explain the employee’s grievance;


2. sum up the employee’s grievance;


3. respond on the employee’s behalf to any view expressed at the meeting.




7. The companion can also confer with the employee during the meeting. The companion is allowed to participate as fully as reasonably possible in the meeting. The companion has no right to answer questions on the employee’s behalf, or to address the meeting if the employee does not wish it or to permit management from explaining their case.



No unreasonable delay
---------------------


1. Each stage or action under this procedure must be taken without unreasonable delay.


2. Management will notify the employee and explain any delay in progressing any stage of this procedure.
