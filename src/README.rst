This repository contains the full source of all policies and procedures
created and used used by Lexden Montessori.

Our aim is to create a complete set of up-to-date, lawful, practical
documents that can be used in any school setting (within the UK).  In
origin these documents are written for a pre-school, but much of the 
material is applicable elsewhere.

You are encouraged to use these documents in your own setting, and to
give back any changes that you make to them.
