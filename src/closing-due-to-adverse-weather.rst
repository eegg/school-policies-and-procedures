  Snow Day
    A day on which the nursery was scheduled to open, but which for reasons of weather is designated at short notice to be a non-opening day. 
    (Note that this term can also be applied to days on which closure was due to weather conditions other than snow; we use the term for reasons of convention.)


We are committed to opening our nursery on as many days as is possible.
However, we recognise that opening may not always be possible.
We also recognise that, when closure is caused by the weather, determination of this impossibility may have to happen at very short notice.
We aim to manage our *Snow Days* so as to minimise the disruption that adverse weather has on our guardians and staff.

The guiding principle to our procedures is the question: is the disruption caused by calling a *Snow Day* less than the disruption caused by *not* calling it?



Procedures
----------


Deciding to call a Snow Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Designation of a school day as a Snow Day is at the discretion of the Nursery Manager.
* Once designated, the *Snow Day* is valid up until the end of session on that day.
  (That is, it cannot be un-designated.)
* The decision to call a *Snow Day* is valid for a maximum of one day.
  (That is, during multiple days of adverse weather, the *Snow Day* must be decided upon for each individual day.)


Informing guardians and staff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A *Snow Day* may be declared at any time on any date on which nursery is in session.
* When this declaration has been decided upon, one of the following is done immediately:

 * The following notice placed on the *School Telephone* answering machine:
   "Thank you for calling *The Nursery*.
   Nursery is not in session for the rest of the day due to adverse weather.
   If you are due to drop off your child, please make alternative arrangements.
   If you have already dropped off your child, arrange to have him collected as soon as possible.
   This message is valid until the end of today, *Weekday* the *X*th of *Month*."
 * If possible, the above message also placed on the *School Website via the Twitter Feed* and any other electronic media.
 * A notice placed on the main entrance of *The Nursery*, with the following message:
   "*The Nursery* is not in session on *Weekday* the *X*th of *Month*.
   Please make alternative arrangements.
   Thank you."

* In the event that a day is declared a Snow Day, this decision will be made not after 08:00 A.M. of that day.


Finding whether a day has been declared a Snow Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* It is the responsibility of the guardian to determine whether the day has been determined to be a Snow Day.
  They may do this by calling the School Telephone and requesting the Nursery Manager or, failing that,
  listening to the dated message in which the Nursery Manager may decide to inform guardians that the nursery is closed.
* This procedure must be followed each day of ongoing adverse weather conditions.

PLEASE NOTE THAT SNOW DAYS ARE NON REFUNDABLE AND NON EXCHANGEABLE
