Policy
------

No child is excluded from *The Setting* due to their toileting abilities.
As such, all range of toileting abilities are catered for.
Toilet-training is a self-care skill and we promote it;
we work with parents to achieve this when the child is ready.



Procedures
----------


Toilet training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Children are encouraged to ask a member of staff if they need to use the toilet.
* Staff closely monitor Toileting, even if the child attempts it independently.

* Older children access the toilet
  when they have the need to and are encouraged to be independent.
* Nappy-changing is a time to promote independence in young children.
* Young children are encouraged to take an interest in using the toilet;
  they may just want to sit on it and talk to a friend who is also using the toilet.
* They should be encouraged to wash their hands
  and have soap and towels to hand.
  They should be allowed time for some play
  as they explore the water and the soap.


When a child requests to use the W.C.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a child asks a member of staff to use the toilet, the staff member should:

#. Accompany that child to the nearest vacant of the *Children's W.C.s*.
#. Wait inconspicuously for the child to exit or to be available to help the child.
#. Ask whether they have flushed.
#. Supervise the child in:

 * washing their hands with soap and water,
 * drying their hands with a paper towel from the dispenser.

#. Inconspicuously check the cleanliness of the W.C.
#. Ensure that the child returns to their previous classroom.

The following rules will always be followed:

* The door to the W.C. may only be closed when no members of staff are present in the cubicle.


When a nappy requires changing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: warning

   Failure to follow this procedure may constitute neglect and will be a disciplinary matter.

For every child in session,
that child requires their nappy changing
in either event that:

* a member of staff suspects that
  the child's nappy is soiled, or
* a member of staff identifies,
  by regular checking, that
  the child's nappy is soiled, or
* 150 minutes have passed since
  the child was last changed
  or since the child arrived.

When this applies,
the following procedure is performed by either:

* the child's *Key Person* if available, or alternatively
* another member of staff who is qualified.

.. container:: explanation

   **Why is the carpet mat not placed on a high surface?**

   There are risks involved in placing the carpet mat on a high surface.
   Following the procedure on the floor eliminates these.
   The mats ensure a safe and hygienic surface.

#. Put on

   * a fresh plastic apron, and
   * fresh disposable gloves.

#. Place the carpet mat on the floor in the *Nappy-Changing Area*.
#. Place the changing mat on top of the carpet mat.
#. Move the following from the child's tray/bag
   to a position next to the changing mat:

   * the child's nappies/pull-ups
   * the child's changing wipes
   * a nappy bag.

#. Using the child's wipes,
   clean the child of all urine and feces,
   Ensure you do not pull faces or make negative comments about
   urine, feces, or the child's genitals.

#. Place one of the child's nappies on the child.
#. If the child's clothes are soiled or wet:

   * place them in a white bag and tie the bag
   * place the bag in the child's rucksack
   * replace with child's clothes from the child's spare clothes bag. 

   Otherwise,
   re-dress the child in those clothes.

#. Accompany the child to their classroom.
#. Return to the Nappy -Changing Area.
#. Place in the *Nappy Bin*:
   the used nappy, gloves, apron, and wipes.
#. Clean the changing mat with anti-bacterial spray.
#. Record the event in the *Nappy-Changing Record*.
#. If you are not the child's *Key Person*,
   notify the child's *Key Person* of
   any unusual Toileting patterns for that child.


When a parent drops off their child
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the child is not toilet-trained,
the parent will provide sufficient disposable nappies and wipes for that day.


When a parent collects their child
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The child's *Key Person*

* if necessary, notifies the parent of the presence of dirty clothes in their child's rucksack.

  tells the parent.
