   Condition

     Illness or injury.

We endeavour to maintain the health of our *Team Members* and our children.
We are, however, an educational setting,
and not in the business of providing healthcare.
Our strategy for maintaining the health of the setting
has four parts, ensuring for children and *Team Members* that:

#. `The Setting is a healthy environment`_,
   where healthy attendants can maintain their health
#. while anyone is
   ill
   or
   contagious in any way,
   `they are removed from The Setting`_
#. emergency conditions are
   `treated and passed to the emergency services`_
   as soon as possible
#. if they are a child not removed
   on the above criteria,
   we provide limited 
   `administering of medication`_

In our setting staff are able to take action to apply first aid treatment in the event of an accident involving a child or adult.
At least one member of staff with current first aid training is on the premises or on an outing at any one time.
The first aid qualification includes first aid training for infants and young children.

Removal of illness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Noticing conditions
```````````````````

We are not diagnosticians.
However,
the following table
gives rudimentary instruction to *Team Members*
on how to deal with signs of conditions.
The table is far from comprehensive,
so First-Aid-qualified staff must judge what the appropriate action is
given their understanding of the symptoms.

If a child has any symptoms of an *Emergency*,
go to `Dealing with emergency conditions`_.
Else, if the child has any symptoms of type *Exclusion*,
inform the child's *Key Person*,
after which the *Key Person* will follow the procedure at 
`Removing a child from The Setting`_.

========================  ==================  ==============================  ===================================================
Symptom                   Type                Confirmation procedure          Treatment
========================  ==================  ==============================  ===================================================
**high temperature**      Exclusion           use the `ear thermometer`_      remove top clothing; administer paediatric suspensions of either paracetamol or ibuprofen if permitted on the non-prescription medication form
**low temperature**       Exclusion           use the `ear thermometer`_
**vomiting**              Exclusion
**diarrhoea**             Exclusion
**pains**                 Exclusion
**sore throat**           Exclusion
**nasal discharge**       Exclusion
**FAST symptoms**         Emergency
========================  ==================  ==============================  ===================================================


FAST symptoms
"""""""""""""

*Staff Members* are aware of the **FAST** group of four groups of symptoms of anaphylaxis:

* **F** ace: itchiness, redness, swelling
* **A** irway: trouble breathing, swallowing, speaking
* **S** tomach: pain, vomiting or diarrhea
* **T** otal: hives, rash, itchiness, swelling, weakness, paleness, sense of doom, loss of consciousness


Removing a child from The Setting
`````````````````````````````````

If a *Key Person* is informed that
(or themselves notices that)
one of their children is ill,
they will:

#. If possible,
   confirm the observations using the confirmation procedure
   in the `Noticing conditions`_ table.   
   If the observations were baseless,
   stop.

#. Go through the contacts on the *Emergency Information Card*.
   Inform the first successful contact that
   the child must be collected as soon as possible.
   
#. Alleviate confirmed symptoms,
   by using the non-medicinal means
   in the `Noticing conditions`_ table.

#. Repeat contact with the successful contact
   every 30 minutes in order to:
   
   * inform the contact of the child's state
   * get an updated estimate of their time of arrival at |The Setting|

#. Inform the guardians of
   the policy on the `Exclusion guidance table`_.


Admitting a child to The Setting
````````````````````````````````

Every time a child arrives at |The Setting|,
they are only admitted if
the following criteria
can be fulfilled:

* The child displays no symptoms in the `Noticing conditions`_ table
* If the child was excluded on their last visit to the nursery,
  the guardians either:
  
  * can display a `GP Permission Form` signed by the child's GP, or
  * have followed the exclusion times in the `Exclusion guidance table`_.


* All medication in the child's `Health Details Card`_
  and any `Short-term Prescribed Medication Form`_
  is present at |The Setting|
  in accordance with the requirements of the `Stored medication checklist`_.


Dealing with emergency conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an emergency condition is identified

#. A first-aid qualified member of staff, preferably the child's *Key Person*, is assigned to stay with the child.

#. The *Illnesses and medication officer*
   finds the following forms for the child:
   
   * The `Health Details Card`_, or failing that, the `Emergency Information Card`_
   * `Short-term Prescribed Medication Form`_

#. Another *Team Member* is assigned to
   contact emergency services
   using the *Emergency Number*
   and informs them of:
   
   * the symptoms
   * the child's health details on the `Health Details Card`_

#. If deemed necessary,
   the qualified first-aider follows the ABBB protocols:
   
   #. **Airway**
   #. **Breathing**
   #. **Bleeding**
   #. **Bones**


#. On the arrival of the emergency services,
   all the child's medication and details in the care of |The Setting|
   is handed over with the child.

#. |The Illnesses and Medication Officer|:

   #. notifies Ofsted
   #. makes a report to the Health and Safety Executive using the RIDDOR format


An accident happens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an accident happens to a child and a Team Member has identified the need to have the child collected by the parent or the emergency services, the Team Member will decide if it is necessary to have the child transported to hospital without the guardian if the guardian has not arrived within a period of not more than 1 hour following the accident.
It may be necessary, in the interests of the child, to transport the child immediately to hospital and, in this case, Team Members will await the arrival of the emergency services in order to do this and the guardians will be informed to meet us at the hospital.
Team Members will administer first-aid to attend to the immediate safety and well-being of the child before the emergency services or guardians arrive. Team Members will monitor the child's condition using an 'accident monitoring form' and will continually reassess the situation until either the emergency services or the guardian arrives.
If first-aid has stabilised the child's condition, the guardian has been successfully contacted and advised that they will need to collect the child, take the child immediately to a Healthcare Professional and is on their way to the setting, Team Members will await the arrival of the guardian up to, but not exceeding a period of 1 hour following the accident.  After this period has elapsed, the emergency services will be called.

In all cases:

* The child's guardian is contacted to inform them of the accident
* A member of staff records all details in the `Accident Book`_.
* When the child is collected,
  the staff member notifies the collector,
  and asks the collector to sign in the Accident Book.


Administering medication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Administration of on-going medication
`````````````````````````````````````

All Team Members are aware of
the children's details on the `Regularly Administered Medication List`_.
At the times at which medication is to be administered,
the Team Member:


#. Records, in the `Medication Record Book`_:

   * name of child
   * name and strength of medication
   * the date and time of dose
   * dose given and method
   * signature of the Team Member, a witness and the guardian

#. Returns the medication to the *Medication Cabinet*.
#. Takes note to ensure that
   guardians sign the `Medication Record Book`_
   at the end of the day.


Maintaining the Medication Cabinet
``````````````````````````````````

Every month,
the *Illnesses and medication Officer*:

#. Checks of the `First-Aid Box`_ that it:

   * is secure and intact
   * is inaccessible by children

#. Checks for all items in the *Medication Cabinet* that:

   * it is in-date

#. Removes
   all items that do not fulfil these criteria,
   and:
   
   * if the guardian is contactable: returns it to them
   * else: destroys it.


Medication on outings
`````````````````````

Before going on an outing:

* The *Illnesses and medication Officer*:

  #. ensures that
     all medication for the child
     is
     inside one sealed clear plastic box
     which is clearly labelled with the child's name.

  #. ensures that the child's
     *Emergency Information Card*
     is present with the plastic box.

* The *Illnesses and medication Officer*
  ensures that
  the following are taken:
  
  * The `Allergy List`_
  * The `Regularly Administered Medication List`_
  * The `Medication Record Book`_
  * The Non-prescription medication permission list


Enforcement
-----------

Where children are capable of understanding when they need medication,
for example with asthma,
they should be encouraged to tell their key person what they need.
However, this does not replace staff vigilance in knowing and responding when a child requires medication.

Guardians are made aware of the `Allergy List`_.
