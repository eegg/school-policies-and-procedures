Policy
------

We endeavour to maintain the health of our *Team Members* and our children.
We are, however, an educational setting,
and not in the business of providing healthcare.
Our strategy for maintaining the health of the setting
has four parts, ensuring for children and *Team Members* that:

#. `The Setting is a healthy environment`_,
   where healthy attendants can maintain their health
#. while anyone is
   ill
   or
   contagious in any way,
   `they are removed from The Setting`_
#. emergency illnesses are
   `treated and passed to the emergency services`_
   as soon as possible
#. if they are a child not removed
   on the above criteria,
   we provide limited 
   `administering of medication`_

Removal of illness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Noticing illness
````````````````

We are not diagnosticians.
However,
the following table
gives rudimentary instruction to *Team Members*
on how to deal with signs of illness.

If a child has any symptoms of type *Hospital*,
go to `Dealing with emergency illnesses`_.
Else, if the child has any symptoms of type *Exclusion*,
inform the child's *Key Person*,
after which the *Key Person* will follow the procedure at 
`Removing a child from The Setting`_.

========================  ==================  ==============================  ===================================================
Symptom                   Type                Confirmation procedure          Non-medicinal treatment
========================  ==================  ==============================  ===================================================
**high temperature**      Exclusion           use the `ear thermometer`_      remove top clothing; sponge head with cool water
**low temperature**       Exclusion           use the `ear thermometer`_
**vomiting**              Exclusion
**diarrhoea**             Exclusion
**pains**                 Exclusion
**sore throat**           Exclusion
**nasal discharge**       Exclusion
**FAST symptoms**         Hospital

FAST symptoms
"""""""""""""

*Staff Members* memorise the **FAST** group of four groups of symptoms of anaphylaxis:

* **F** ace: itchiness, redness, swelling
* **A** irway: trouble breathing, swallowing, speaking
* **S** tomach: pain, vomiting or diarrhea
* **T** otal: hives, rash, itchiness, swelling, weakness, paleness, sense of doom, loss of consciousness


Removing a child from The Setting
`````````````````````````````````

If a *Key Person* is informed that
(or themselves notices that)
one of their children is ill,
they will:

#. If possible,
   confirm the observations using the confirmation procedure
   in the `Noticing illness`_ table.   
   If the observations were baseless,
   stop.

#. Go through the contacts on the *Emergency Information Card*.
   Inform the first successful contact that
   the child must be collected as soon as possible.
   
#. Alleviate confirmed symptoms,
   by using the non-medicinal means
   in the `Noticing illness`_ table.

#. Repeat contact with the successful contact
   every 30 minutes in order to:
   
   * inform the contact of the child's state
   * get an updated estimate of their time of arrival at |The Setting|

#. Inform the guardians of
   the policy on the `Exclusion guidance table`_.


Admitting a child to The Setting
````````````````````````````````

Every time a child arrives at |The Setting|,
they are only admitted if
the following criteria
can be fulfilled:

* The child displays no symptoms in the `Noticing illness`_ table
* If the child was excluded on their last visit to the nursery,
  the guardians either:
  
  * can display a `GP Permission Form` signed by the child's GP, or
  * have followed the exclusion times in the `Exclusion guidance table`_.


* All medication in the child's `Health Details Card`_
  and any `Short-term Prescribed Medication Form`_
  is present at |The Setting|
  in accordance with the requirements of the `Stored medication checklist`_.


Dealing with emergency illnesses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an emergency is identified
using the `Noticing illness`_ table:

#. The child's *Key Person* stays with the child.

#. The *Illnesses and medication officer*
   finds the following forms for the child:
   
   * The `Health Details Card`_, or failing that, the `Emergency Information Card`_
   * `Short-term Prescribed Medication Form`_

#. Another *Team Member* is assigned to
   contact emergency services
   using the *Emergency Number*
   and informs them of:
   
   * the symptoms
   * the child's health details on the `Health Details Card`_

#. If deemed necessary,
   the child's *Key Person* follows the ABC protocols:
   
   #. **Airway**
   #. **Breathing**
   #. **Circulation**
   
#. On the arrival of the emergency services,
   all the child's medication in the care of |The Setting|
   is handed over with the child.



Administering medication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Administration of on-going medication
`````````````````````````````````````

The *Key Person* is aware of
their children's details on the `Regularly Administered Medication List`_.
At the times at which medication is to be administered,
the *Key Person*:


#. Records, in the `Medication Record Book`_:

   * name of child
   * name and strength of medication
   * the date and time of dose
   * dose given and method
   * signature of the child's *Key Person* and the guardian

#. Returns the medication to the *Medication Cabinet*.
#. Takes note to ensure that
   guardians sign the `Medication Record Book`_
   at the end of the day.


Maintaining the Medication Cabinet
``````````````````````````````````

Every month,
the *Illnesses and medication Officer*:

#. Checks of the `First-Aid Box`_ that it:

   * is secure and intact
   * is inaccessible by children

#. Checks for all items in the *Medication Cabinet* that:

   * it is in-date

#. Removes
   all items that do not fulfil these criteria,
   and:
   
   * if the guardian is contactable: returns it to them
   * else: destroys it.


Medication on outings
`````````````````````

Before going on an outing:

* The *Key Person* of each child:

  #. ensures that
     all medication for the child
     is
     inside one sealed clear plastic box
     which is clearly labelled with the child's name.

  #. ensures that the child's
     *Emergency Information Card*
     is present with the plastic box.

* The *Illnesses and medication Officer*
  ensures that
  the following are taken:
  
  * The `Allergy List`_
  * The `Regularly Administered Medication List`_
  * The `Medication Record Book`_


Enforcement
-----------

Where children are capable of understanding when they need medication,
for example with asthma,
they should be encouraged to tell their key person what they need.
However, this does not replace staff vigilance in knowing and responding when a child requires medication.

Guardians are made aware of the `Allergy List`_.
