Policy
------

Children benefit from being taken out of the setting to go on visits or trips to local parks or other suitable venues for activities which enhance their learning experiences.
Some settings do not have direct access to outdoor provision on their premises and will need to take children out daily.
Staff in our setting ensure that there are procedures to keep children safe on outings; all staff and volunteers are aware of and follow the procedures below.

Different types of outings take place and each will require slightly different preparations and staffing levels.
These include:

* Trips on foot, e.g. visits to the park, the library, local markets and places of interest
* Trips on public transport to places like museums, farms, //etc.//


Procedures

A child joins

stating that their child can be taken on outings

Risk assessments

Visits to farms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The outings procedure is followed.
* Children wash their hands after contact with animals.
* Outdoor footwear worn to visit farms are cleaned of mud and debris and should not be worn indoors.



Operational procedures for outings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same standard of care and interaction with the children is expected of staff, volunteers and students on outings.
The worker’s prime responsibility on outings is to ensure the safety of the children.
However they will expected to balance this responsibility with ensuring that children have the maximum opportunity to experience and explore new environments, to socialise and to have fun.



Communication with parents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parents of children taking part in an off-site activity should be provided with all appropriate information about the intended visit.
Parents must give their permission in writing before a child can be involved in any off-site activities.

Funding for off-site activities is provided mainly by parental contributions.
This must be made clear to parents in all correspondence about an educational visit at the planning stage.


Further health and safety considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All adults accompanying a party must be made aware, by the managers, of the emergency procedures which will apply.
Each adult should be provided with an emergency telephone number.
This will normally be the managers' numbers. 

Before a party leaves the nursery managers will provided a list of everyone, children and adults, travelling with the party, together with a programme and timetable for the activity. 

The safety of the party, and especially the children, is of paramount importance.
During the activity the managers must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that safety.
This involves taking note of any information provided by medical registration forms, and ensuring that children are both safe and well looked after at all times.
