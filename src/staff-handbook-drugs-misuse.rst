Policy
------

The employers’ policy is to provide a workplace free of alcohol and drugs, and to take reasonable measures to ensure that employee alcohol or drug use does not jeopardise the success and safety of its operations. The possession of drugs at work for any reason other than medical is forbidden.



Violations of policy
--------------------

Among the actions that are not permitted at work or while otherwise engaged in the conduct of the employers business are:

using, possessing, distributing, selling, dispensing, manufacturing, transferring, offering, furnishing or being under the influence of illegal or illicit drugs or other controlled substances;

being under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and

working, without notice to your manager, while using prescription or non-prescription drugs which may impair alertness, judgement or co-ordination.

Thus the following rules apply:



1. If an employee is found consuming alcohol or taking drugs, at work or is under the influence of alcohol or drugs in the workplace then this will be treated as gross misconduct under the Disciplinary Procedure. Dismissal may result even for the first offence.


2. Employees must inform their manager if they are taking drugs for medical reasons and in particular if they are likely to affect their ability to work.


3. Employees may be required to undergo a medical examination in order to ascertain whether there is a problem in relation to drink or drugs which is affecting their ability to work. They may be suspended from work until the problem has been resolved. We will decide whether to require an employee to undergo a programme of rehabilitation or whether abuse of alcohol or drugs should be treated as a disciplinary matter.


4. If an employee is offered a programme of rehabilitation and does not comply with the programme this may be treated as a disciplinary matter.


5. Employees should be aware that the employers will not hesitate to inform the police if it believes that there has been an abuse of controlled drugs for which criminal sanctions are appropriate.



It is the employee’s responsibility to:



1. know, understand and comply with the policy, and


2. maintain a safe, alcohol and drug-free workplace.
