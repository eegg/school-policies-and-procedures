Policy
------

This policy describes the employers guidelines about access to and disclosure of electronic mail messages sent or received by employees using the employers e-mail system. Whilst we respect the individual privacy of our employees, employee privacy does not extend to the employee’s work-related conduct, or to the use of the employers provided equipment or supplies. You should be aware that the following guidelines might affect your privacy in the work place.

A failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.



Management’s right to access information
----------------------------------------

The electronic mail system has been installed by the employers to facilitate business communications. Although each employee has an individual password to access this system, it and all e-mail communications are accessible at all times by management.

We reserve the right to monitor all e-mail messages. In the same way as the post is checked, the monitoring of e-mails is necessary to ensure no business related messages are ignored during the absence of any individual employee; and to check that no employee is using our e-mail or Internet facilities for improper purposes. We therefore also reserve the right to retrieve the contents of messages for the purpose of monitoring whether the use of the e-mail system is legitimate, to find lost messages or to retrieve messages lost due to computer failure, to assist in the investigations of wrongful acts, or to comply with any legal obligation. Therefore, all systems may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections and should be treated like other shared filing systems.



Passwords
---------

All system passwords and encryption keys must be available to management and you may not use passwords that are unknown to your manager or install encryption programmes without passing encryption keys to your manager.

Employees are prohibited from both accessing and attempting to access the e-mail location of another employee without authorisation and from transmitting from a co-worker’s email location.

If you are given access to the e-mail system you are responsible for the security of your terminal and you must not allow the terminal to be used by an unauthorised person.

All employees must keep their personal password confidential and change it regularly. When leaving your terminal unattended or on leaving the office you should ensure you log off the system to prevent unauthorised users using your terminal in your absence.

All e-mail messages are business records therefore, you should not assume that messages are confidential. Back-up copies of e-mails may be maintained and referenced for business and legal reasons.
