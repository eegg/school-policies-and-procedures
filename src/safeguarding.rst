Policies
--------

For each child enrolled, |The Setting| will ensure:

* that he is not subject to abuse_
* his right to privacy and confidentiality
* all his other legal rights

|The Setting| will:

* be equipped to recognise any violations of the above
* work with guardians, the community, and external bodies, where appropriate, to ensure the above
* not rely on unconditional trust
* build a 'culture of safety'
  in which children are protected from abuse
* Respond promptly to
  all incidents or concerns of abuse that may occur
  in accordance with `What to do if you’re Worried a Child is Being Abused`_
* promote staff awareness of abuse issues through training


Procedures
----------


A Team Member is hired
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a new *Team Member* is hired,

* |The Safeguarding Officer| requires:

  * an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, and
  * a minimum of two written references from 

    * a previous employer, or
    * an educational establishment.

  |The Safeguarding Officer| allows the applicant to challenge the information.

* the Team Member takes part in an induction
  which includes a small Safeguarding workshop,
  after which they are given a Safeguarding pack.


Observing Team Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each *Volunteer*,
at least one *Staff Member* is present with them at any time.


A visit is booked
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Staff Member* taking the booking
records the following details in *The Diary*:
  
* Name of guardian
* Contact details for the guardian
* Name, age, and sex of child
* Date and time of booked visit


A visitor arrives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a visitor V announces his arrival at *The Setting* via the intercom,

#. A *Staff Member* S ensures that
 
   * V can claim, via the intercom system,
     without hesitation or back-tracking,
     a legitimate reason for visiting; and
   * Either:

     * A *Staff Member* recognises V
       as a *Child Collector* of a *Child* booked in at that time,
       by comparison with photos in the *Enrolment Form* for that *Child*.
       In this case, V is a **Visiting Child Collector**.
     * V can establish his identity against
       an entry in *The Diary*.
       In this case, V is a **Guest**.

#. If V satisfies the requirements:

   #. V signs in:
   
      * if V is a **Visiting Child Collector**,
        on the *Arrivals and Departures Sheets*.
      * if V is a **Guest**,
        in the *Visitors' Book*,
        with the purpose of the visit.

   #. V is accompanied by at least one *Staff Member* throughout the visit.
   #. V signs out in the same document as that on which V signed in.

#. If V does not satisfy the requirements,
   S denies him entry.


A child makes a disclosure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a *Team Member* T is the recipient of a disclosure by a child C,

#. T listens to C, without
   
   * displaying a reaction,
   * challenging C's disclosure, or
   * questioning C.

#. T reassures C that

   * T will (and is required to) take action,
   * only people that need to know will be told,
   * it was not C's fault,
   * speaking was the right thing to do.

#. T follows procedures `A Team Member suspects abuse`_.


A Team Member suspects abuse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a *Team Member* T suspects that a child C is a victim of abuse_,
T will

#. note down, as soon as possible, on an *Incident Sheet*:
 
   * the date and time of the observation
   * any reasons for suspicion,
     from the list under `Indicators of Abuse`_,
     if necessary using a *Body Diagram Sheet*
   * any exact words spoken by C
   * the names of any other person present
   * the name and signature of T
   * the date and time of the entry

#. pass the *Incident Sheet* to the |The Safeguarding Officer|,
   after which `Determining Abuse`_ will be followed.
#. if necessary, seeks support.


Determining Abuse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When |The Safeguarding Officer| is
approached by a *Team Member* T
with a suspicion that a child C
is a victim of abuse_ by some suspect S,
he will:

#. Ensure that at least one *Staff Member* is present with S in |The Setting| at all times.
#. open a file in the `Child Protection Record`_, recording

   * Details of C, T, and S
   * the date and time he was approached
   * the date and time he noted down these details

#. regard the changes as `evidence of abuse`_, unless and only unless:

   * C has not been placed on the Safeguarding Children Register, *and*
   * immediate, clear, and consistent innocent explanation for the changes is given,
     *without* any prompting, by
  
     * *Staff Members* to all *Team Members* at large, *or*
     * C's *Guardians* to any *Staff Member*.

#. if S is a *Team Member*,
   follow the procedures under `An allegation is made against a Team Member`_.

If the |The Safeguarding Officer| finds `evidence of abuse`_,
he will follow the procedures under `Reporting evidence of abuse`_.
Otherwise,
the file in the `Child Protection Record`_ is marked as closed,
with the reasons why so.


.. _evidence of abuse:

Reporting evidence of abuse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: warning

   Parents of a suspected victim of abuse
   are only informed of this suspicion
   if the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*
   gives permission for this.

When |The Safeguarding Officer| has found `evidence of abuse`_ of child C, he should:

#. Record in the `Child Protection Record`_ under C's file that
   the `indicators of abuse`_ are being treated as `evidence of abuse`_, and why.
#. Contact the *Local Safeguarding Children Board* verbally.
#. Inform all appropriate *Team Members* that
   contact has been made with the *Local Safeguarding Children Board* concerning C.
#. Within 48 hours of the above contact,
   securely send complete copies of C's file in the `Child Protection Record`_
   to the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*.
#. Co-operate fully with
   the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*
   and/or
   the police or another agency identified by the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*
   in any subsequent investigation.

When *Team Members* are informed by the |The Safeguarding Officer|
that contact has been made with the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*,
they should take care not to influence the outcome
either through the way we speak to children
or by asking questions of children.


An allegation is made against a Team Member
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When |The Safeguarding Officer| is approached by
anyone with an accusation that a *Team Member* T is a perpetrator of abuse_,
he will:

#. Refer it immediately to:

   * *the Children's Safeguarding Service on 01245 436744*
   * Ofsted
   * if the accusee is |The Setting Manager|: Children Schools and Families

#. Request of |The Setting Manager| that
   T is suspended,
   on the same pay rate,
   from entering |The Setting|,
   until the investigation is complete.

#. Seek advice from Children Schools and Families.


Upon completion of investigation
````````````````````````````````

If T is found innocent,
|The Safeguarding Officer|
requests of |The Setting Manager| that
T is immediately reinstated in their original post.
