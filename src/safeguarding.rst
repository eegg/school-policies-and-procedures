+----------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+

Any *Team Member* noting *any* of the above will suspect that child is a victim of abuse_.
All *Team Members* suspecting a child of abuse_ will:

#. If a disclosure is one of the reasons for suspicion,
   follow the procedures under `Dealing with disclosures`_
#. note down, as soon as possible, on an *Incident Sheet*:
 
   * all reasons for suspicion, from the list under `Indicators of Abuse`_, if necessary using a *Body Diagram Sheet*
   * the date and time suspicion was raised
   * the date and time these details were noted down

#. store the *Incident Sheet* safely.
#. pass their suspicions and the reasons for it to the |The Child Protection Officer|,
   after which the procedures under `Internal procedures for determining Abuse`_ will be followed.


Dealing with disclosures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where a *Team Member* is the recipient of a disclosure, he:

* listens to the child, without displaying a reaction to what they say
* accepts what the child says, without challenging it
* does not *question* the child
* gives assurance that she or he will take action (but does not make promises as to what conclusions will come of it)
* reassures the child that it was not his fault
* tells the child that speaking was the right thing to do
* makes a written record after the event in the `Child Protection Record`_ that includes:

  * the date and time of the observation
  * the exact words spoken by the child, as far as possible
  * the names of any other person present at the time
  * the name and signature of that staff member
  * the date and time of the entry

* if considered necessary, seeks support for himself.



Internal procedures for determining Abuse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When |The Child Protection Officer| is
approached by a *Team Member* with a suspicion of abuse_,
or by anyone with an accusation of abuse_ against a *Team Member*,
he will:

#. Ensure that,
   for each suspect or accusee,
   at least one *Staff Member* is present with them when in |The Setting|.
#. note down in the `Child Protection Record`_:

   * the child of concern
   * who approached him (whether a *Team Member* or a *Guardian*)
   * the date and time he was approached
   * the date and time he noted down these details

#. regard the changes as `evidence of abuse`_, unless and only unless:

   * the child has not been placed on the Safeguarding Children Register, *and*
   * immediate, clear, and consistent innocent explanation for the changes is given, *without* any prompting:
  
     * by *Staff Members* to all *Team Members* at large, *or*
     * the *Guardians* of the child to any *Staff Member*.

#. If the accusee is a *Team Member*,
   follow the procedures under `Dealing with allegations against staff`_.

If the |The Child Protection Officer| finds `evidence of abuse`_, he will follow the procedures under `Reporting Abuse to external bodies`_.
If however he is satisfied that the *Indicators* do not constitute `evidence of abuse`_,
the file in the `Child Protection Record`_ is marked as closed, with the reasons why so.



Reporting Abuse to external bodies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the |The Child Protection Officer| has found `evidence of abuse`_, he should:

#. Contact the *Local Safeguarding Children Board* verbally.
#. Record in the open file in the `Child Protection Record`_
   that the `indicators of abuse`_ are being treated as `evidence of abuse`_, and why.
#. Inform all *Team Members* that
   contact has been made with the *Local Safeguarding Children Board* concerning the child.
#. Within 48 hours of the above contact,
   securely send complete copies of the file in the `Child Protection Record`_
   to the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*.
#. Prepare to co-operate fully with
   the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*
   and/or
   the police or another agency identified by the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*
   in any subsequent investigation.

When *Team Members* are informed by the |The Child Protection Officer|
that contact has been made with the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*,
they should:

* take care not to influence the outcome
  either through
  the way we speak to children
  or
  by asking questions of children


Dealing with allegations against staff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When |The Child Protection Officer| is approached by
anyone with an accusation of abuse_ against a *Team Member*,
he will:

* Refer it immediately to:

  * *Social Services*
  * Ofsted
  * if the accusee is |The Setting Manager|: Children Schools and Families
  
* Request of |The Setting Manager| that
  the accusee is suspended,
  on the same pay rate,
  from entering |The Setting|,
  until the investigation is complete.

* Seek advice from Children Schools and Families


Upon completion of investigation
````````````````````````````````

If the accusee is found innocent,
|The Child Protection Officer|:

* Requests of |The Setting Manager| that
  the accusee is immediately reinstated in their original post

If the accusee is found innocent,
|The Child Protection Officer|:

* notifies the Independent Barring Board
  so that the guilty may be included on
  the Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Barred List.


Confidentiality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All suspicions and investigations are kept confidential and shared only with those who need to know.
Any information is shared under the guidance of the *Local Safeguarding Children Board*.
DfEE 10/95 acknowledges that Safeguarding Children raises issues of confidentiality that must be clearly understood by all staff in schools.
The Circular advises: 

* If a child confides in a member of staff and requests that the information is kept secret,
  it is important that the member of staff tells the child sensitively that he has a responsibility to refer cases of alleged abuse to the appropriate agencies for the childâ€™s sake.
* Within that context, the child should, however, be assured that the matter will be disclosed only to people who need to know about it.
  Staff who receive information about children and their families in the course of their work should share that information only within appropriate professional contexts.
  Child Protection records should be kept securely locked.


Support to families
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We believe in building trusting and supportive relationships with families, staff and volunteers in the group.
* We make clear to parents our role and responsibilities in relation to child protection, such as for the reporting of concerns, providing information, monitoring of the child, and liaising at all times with the local childrenâ€™s social care team.
* We will continue to welcome the child and the family whilst investigations are being made in relation to any alleged abuse.
* We follow the Child Protection Plan as set by the childâ€™s social care worker in relation to the setting's designated role and tasks in supporting that child and their family, subsequent to any investigation.
* Confidential records kept on a child are shared with the child's parents or those who have parental responsibility for the child in accordance with the Confidentiality and Client Access to Records procedure and only if appropriate under the guidance of the Local Safeguarding Children Board.


Family Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|The Setting| will take every step in its power to build up trusting and supportive relationships between families, staff and volunteers in the group.
Where abuse at home is suspected, the Nursery School will continue to welcome the child and family while investigations proceed.


Informing parents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Parents are normally the first point of contact.
* If a suspicion of abuse is recorded, parents are informed at the same time as the report is made, except where the guidance of the Local Safeguarding Children Board does not allow this.
* This will usually be the case where the parent is the likely abuser.
  In these cases the investigating officers will inform parents.


Child protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The named person with responsibility for child protection in the nursery is the managers.
We will follow the procedures for child protection (see Child Protection Policy).
If any member of staff suspects that a child in their class may be the victim of abuse, they should not try to investigate, but should immediately inform the person responsible in the nursery for child protection (the managers) about their concerns.
We require all adults employed in the nursery to have an up to date CRB record, in order to check that there is no evidence of offences involving children or abuse.
All the adults in our nursery share responsibility for keeping our children safe.
We may on occasion report concerns which, on investigation, prove unfounded.
It is better to be safe than sorry, and we trust that parents, while they will naturally be upset, will nevertheless accept that the nursery acted in the childâ€™s best interests.


Nursery security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While it is difficult to make the nursery site totally secure, we will do all we can to ensure that the nursery is a safe environment for the children to play and learn in and staff to work in.
We review security measures regularly, and carry out a daily Risk Assessment and draw upon the advice of experts (e.g. police officers, fire officers, architects and other consultants).
We require all adult visitors who arrive in normal nursery hours to sign the visitorsâ€™ book in the reception area, and to wear an identification badge at all times whilst on the nursery premises.


Stranger awareness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staff are constantly alert to any strangers on the premises.
We will not open the door to anyone that is unknown to us and will NEVER release a child to anybody other than the parent/guardian unless a permission form is signed.
Childrenâ€™s names and identity are protected at all times and staff will not disclose information about any child attending the nursery to any person other than those immediately responsible for the child.
If the child was the subject of a child protection issue, information would only be shared with Social Services or other agencies involved in a strictly confidential manner.
Parents have a responsibility to inform staff if anyone other than themselves is collecting their child for whatever reason.
Staff will ask parent to complete form situated in the cloakroom area as to who is going to be collecting their child only then will they be released from our care.
If we are unsure at any time, parents will be contacted to confirm the identity of any person.


Safety of children
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that all activities are safe.
Similarly, staff will always be vigilant for hazards concerning equipment or activities.
If a member of staff has any concerns about the childrenâ€™s safety, they should bring them to the attention of the manager before that particular activity takes place.
We do not take any child off the school site without the prior permission of the parent.
If an accident does happen, and it results in an injury to a child, the staff will do all he can to aid the child concerned.
We keep a first aid box in the kitchen area.
All staff are First Aid trained and certificates are kept on the premises.
Should any incident involving injury to a child take place, one of the members of staff who have been first aid trained will be called to assist.
If necessary emergency assistance will be called for.
We record any accident in the accident file involving injury, and in all cases we inform parents and they sign an Accident Form to confirm they have been informed.
Should a child be quite seriously hurt, we contact the parents through the emergency telephone number that we keep on file.
We update these numbers annually, but it is essential that parents inform us when contact details change.
If we cannot reach the parent/guardian or emergency contact we will refer to the Pupil Information Sheet.
There may be rare occasions where it is necessary for staff to restrain a pupil physically, to prevent them from inflicting injury to others, causing self-injury, damaging property, or being disruptive.
In such cases only the minimum force necessary may be used, and any action taken must be only to restrain the pupil.



Personal, Social, Emotional, Development

We teach the children about health and safety in order to equip them with the skills, knowledge and understanding that will enable them to live positive, successful and healthy lives.
Staff take every opportunity to educate children in this regard as part of the Statutory Framework for Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS).

We teach children respect for their bodies, and how to look after themselves.
We discuss these issues with the children in circle times, We also show them how to move and play safely through Physical Development.
Within the Nursery we try to promote everyoneâ€™s safety, so we teach children to spot hazards in both the indoor and outdoor environment, and inform a member of staff.


Internet safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We regularly use the Internet in the nursery, because it has many educational benefits.
In order to minimise the risk of children coming across unsuitable material, we provide constant supervision, and we use only a filtered service, selected links, and child-friendly search engines.
Parents are asked to sign authorisation for their child to use the Internet.
We also seek parental permission before using photographs of children or their work on the nurseryâ€™s website, or in newsletters and other publications.


The health and welfare of staff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The nursery takes very seriously the need to safeguard the health and welfare of all our staff.
This includes their professional development, which we address in our CPD policy.
We also pay particular attention to the assessment and prevention of work-related stress, thus complying with health and safety law.
If a member of staff is experiencing stress at work, he should inform the managers without delay.
The nursery will not tolerate violence, threatening behaviour or abuse directed against members of staff.
If such incidents do occur, the nursery will take the matter very seriously, and take action in line with the LEAâ€™s policy.
The nursery, in consultation with professional advisors, carries out regular risk assessments, with the object of keeping the nursery environment safe.
The managers implement the schoolâ€™s health, safety and welfare policy on a day-to-day basis, and ensure that all staff are aware of the details of the policy as it applies to them.
