Pets

We may want to keep an animal on the setting for an extended period,
even for the extent of its natural life.
When deciding upon a pet, we take account of the views of parents and children when selecting it.


On order to provide for our pets, we:

* provide suitable housing for it, and ensure this is cleaned out regularly
* ensure it is kept safely
* ensure the correct food is offered at the right times
* make arrangements for weekend and holiday care
* register with the local vet
* take out appropriate pet care health insurance
* make sure all vaccinations and other regular health measures are up-to-date and recorded
