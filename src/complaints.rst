Policy
------

We believe that children and parents are entitled to expect courtesy and prompt, careful attention to their needs and wishes.
We welcome suggestions on how to improve our setting and will give prompt and serious attention to any concerns about the running of the setting.
We anticipate that most concerns will be resolved quickly by an informal approach to the appropriate member of staff.
If this does not achieve the desired result, we have a set of procedures for dealing with concerns.
We aim to bring all concerns about the running of our setting to a satisfactory conclusion for all of the parties involved.

We believe that most complaints are made constructively and can be sorted out at an early stage.
We also believe that it is in the best interests of the nursery and parents that complaints should be taken seriously and dealt with fairly and in a way that respects confidentiality.

We aim to offer a welcome to each individual child and family and to provide a warm and caring environment within which all children can learn and develop as they play.
We believe children and parents are entitled to expect courtesy and prompt, careful attention to their needs and wishes.
Are intention is to work in partnership with parents and the community generally and we welcome suggestions on how to improve our group at any time.


Procedures
----------


Making concerns known
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If parents and owners cannot reach an agreement, it might be helpful to invite an external mediator, one who is acceptable to both parties to listen to both sides and offer advice.
A mediator has no legal powers but can help to clarify the situation.
Staff or volunteers within the nursery school will be available to act as mediator if both parties wish it.
The mediator will help define the problem, revive the action so far and suggest further ways in which it might be resolved.
The mediator will keep all discussion confidential.
She/ he will meet with the group if requested and will keep an agreed written record of any meetings that are held and of any advice she/he has given.

This is to be made available to parents as well as to Ofsted inspectors.


Making a complaint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Stage 1
```````

* Any parent who has a concern about an aspect of |The Setting|'s provision should discuss his concerns with |The Complaints Officer|.
* If the complaint is not resolved within twenty-eight days, proceed to Stage 2.


Stage 2
```````

* The parent puts the concerns or complaint in writing to |The Setting Manager|.
* The setting stores written complaints from parents in the *Parent Correspondence Folder*.
* When the investigation into the complaint is completed, |The Setting Manager| organizes a meeting, to include

  * |The Setting Manager|
  * The complainant, and any desired friend, relative, or partner

  in order to to discuss the outcome.
* Within twenty-eight days of the complaint being made,
  |The Setting Manager| will inform the complainant of the outcome of the investigation.
* When the complaint is resolved at this stage, the summative points are logged in the `Complaints Summary Record`_.


Stage 3
```````

* If the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome,
  he requests a meeting with |The Setting Manager|,
  and this is organized to include the same parties as in the previous meeting.
* An agreed written record of the discussion is made
  as well as any decision or action to take as a result.
  All of the parties present at the meeting sign the record and receive a copy of it.
  This signed record signifies that the procedure has concluded.
* If the complaint is resolved at this stage,
  the summative points are logged in the `Complaints Summary Record`_.
  Otherwise, proceed to `Stage 4`_.


Stage 4
```````

* An external mediator is invited to help to settle the complaint.
  This person must

  * be acceptable to both parties
  * listen to both sides
  * keep records of all discussions
  * keep all discussions confidential

  and his role is to

  * offer advice
  * define the problem
  * review the action so far
  * suggest further ways in which it might be resolved.

  He can hold separate meetings with |The Complaints Manager| and the parent,
  if this is decided to be helpful.
* When the mediator has concluded his investigation,
  a final meeting between the parent,
  the setting leader
  and the owner/chair of the management committee
  is held.
  The purpose of this meeting is to
  reach a decision on the action to be taken to deal with the complaint.
  The mediator's advice is used to reach this conclusion.
  The mediator is present at the meeting
  if all parties think this will help a decision to be reached.
* A record of this meeting, including the decision on the action to be taken, is made.
  Everyone present at the meeting signs the record and receives a copy of it.
  This signed record signifies that the procedure has concluded.
 


The role of Ofsted and the Local Safeguarding Children Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Parents may approach Ofsted directly at any stage of this complaints procedure.
  In addition,
  where there seems to be a possible breach of |The Setting|'s registration requirements,
  it is essential to involve Ofsted
  as the registering and inspection body
  with a duty to ensure the Welfare Requirements
  of the Early Years Foundation Stage
  are adhered to.

* These details are displayed on our setting's notice board.


It may be necessary to bring in the local authority registration inspection unit,
who have a duty to ensure laid-down requirements are adhered to
and with whom |The Setting| work in partnership to encourage high standards.
The registering authority would be involved
if a child appeared to be at risk
or where there seemed to be a possible breach of registration requirements.

In these cases both parent and nursery would be informed
and a development worker would work with Childrenâ€™s Schools and Families
to ensure a proper investigation of the complaint
followed by appropriate action.
