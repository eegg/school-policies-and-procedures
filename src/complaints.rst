Policy
------

We believe that children and parents are entitled to expect courtesy and prompt, careful attention to their needs and wishes.
We welcome suggestions on how to improve our setting and will give prompt and serious attention to any concerns about the running of the setting.
We anticipate that most concerns will be resolved quickly by an informal approach to the appropriate member of staff.
If this does not achieve the desired result, we have a set of procedures for dealing with concerns.
We aim to bring all concerns about the running of our setting to a satisfactory conclusion for all of the parties involved.

We believe that most complaints are made constructively and can be sorted out at an early stage.
We also believe that it is in the best interests of the nursery and parents that complaints should be taken seriously and dealt with fairly and in a way that respects confidentiality.

We aim to offer a welcome to each individual child and family and to provide a warm and caring environment within which all children can learn and develop as they play.
We believe children and parents are entitled to expect courtesy and prompt, careful attention to their needs and wishes.
Are intention is to work in partnership with parents and the community generally and we welcome suggestions on how to improve our group at any time.


Procedures
----------


Making concerns known
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A parent who is uneasy about any aspect of the group’s provisions should first of all talk over any worries and anxieties with Jenny Underwood or Zoe Tearle.
If this does not have a satisfactory outcome within 28 days, or if the problem recurs, the parent should put the concerns or complaint in writing and request a meeting with the nursery owners.
Both parents and owners may have a friend, relative or partner present if required and an agreed written record of the discussion should be made.
Most complaints should be resolved informally or at this initial stage.
If the matter is still not sorted out to the parents’ satisfaction, the parents should again contact the owners.
If parents and owners cannot reach an agreement, it might be helpful to invite an external mediator, one who is acceptable to both parties to listen to both sides and offer advice.
A mediator has no legal powers but can help to clarify the situation.
Staff or volunteers within the nursery school will be available to act as mediator if both parties wish it.
The mediator will help define the problem, revive the action so far and suggest further ways in which it might be resolved.
The mediator will keep all discussion confidential.
She/ he will meet with the group if requested and will keep an agreed written record of any meetings that are held and of any advice she/he has given.

All settings are required to keep a 'summary log' of all complaints that reach stage two or beyond.
This is to be made available to parents as well as to Ofsted inspectors.


Making a complaint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Stage 1
```````

* Any parent who has a concern about an aspect of the setting's provision discusses his concerns with the setting leader.
* If the complaint is not resolved amicably and informally, proceed to Stage 2.


Stage 2
```````

* The parent puts the concerns or complaint in writing to the *Setting Manager*.
* The setting stores written complaints from parents in the *Parent Correspondence Folder*.
* When the investigation into the complaint is completed, the *Setting Manager* meets with the parent to discuss the outcome.
* Parents must be informed of the outcome of the investigation within 28 days of making the complaint.
* When the complaint is resolved at this stage, the summative points are logged in the *Complaints Summary Record*.


Stage 3
```````

* If the parent is not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation, he requests a meeting with the *Setting Leader*.
  The parent should have a friend or partner present if desired.
  The *Setting Manager* should have the support of the chairperson of the management committee, or the proprietor/senior manager, present.
* An agreed written record of the discussion is made as well as any decision or action to take as a result.
  All of the parties present at the meeting sign the record and receive a copy of it.
* This signed record signifies that the procedure has concluded.
  When the complaint is resolved at this stage, the summative points are logged in the Complaints Summary Record.


Stage 4
```````

* If at the stage three meeting the parent and setting cannot reach agreement, an external mediator is invited to help to settle the complaint.
  This person should be acceptable to both parties, listen to both sides and offer advice.
  A mediator has no legal powers but can help to define the problem, review the action so far and suggest further ways in which it might be resolved.
* The mediator keeps all discussions confidential.
  He can hold separate meetings with *The Management* and the parent, if this is decided to be helpful.
  The mediator keeps an agreed written record of any meetings that are held and of any advice he gives.


Stage 5
```````

* When the mediator has concluded his investigations, a final meeting between the parent, the setting leader and the owner/chair of the management committee is held.
  The purpose of this meeting is to reach a decision on the action to be taken to deal with the complaint.
  The mediator's advice is used to reach this conclusion.
  The mediator is present at the meeting if all parties think this will help a decision to be reached.
* A record of this meeting, including the decision on the action to be taken, is made.
  Everyone present at the meeting signs the record and receives a copy of it.
  This signed record signifies that the procedure has concluded.


The role of Ofsted and the Local Safeguarding Children Board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Parents may approach Ofsted directly at any stage of this complaints procedure.
  In addition, where there seems to be a possible breach of |The Setting|'s registration requirements, it is essential to involve Ofsted as the registering and inspection body with a duty to ensure the Welfare Requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage are adhered to.
* The number to call Ofsted with regard to a complaint is:

* These details are displayed on our setting's notice board.
* If a child appears to be at risk, our setting follows the procedures of the Local Safeguarding Children Board in our local authority.
* In these cases, both the parent and setting are informed and the setting leader works with Ofsted or the Local Safeguarding Children Board to ensure a proper investigation of the complaint, followed by appropriate action.


In some circumstances, it might be necessary to bring in the local authority registration inspection unit,
who have a duty to ensure laid down requirements are adhered to and with whom we work in partnership to encourage high standards.
The registering authority would be involved if a child appeared to be at risk or where there seemed to be a possible breach of registration requirements.

In these cases both parent and nursery would be informed
and a development worker would work with Children’s Schools and Families to ensure a proper investigation of the complaint followed by appropriate action.


Records
^^^^^^^

* A record of complaints against our setting and/or the children and/or the adults working in our setting is kept, including:

  * the date
  * the circumstances of the complaint
  * how the complaint was managed

* The outcome of all complaints is recorded in the Summary Complaints Record which is available for parents and Ofsted inspectors on request.
