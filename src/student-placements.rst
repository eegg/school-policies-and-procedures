Policy
------

Qualifications and training make an important contribution to
the quality of the care and education provided by early years settings.
We offer placements to students undertaking early years qualifications and training.
We also offer placements for school pupils on work experience.
We provide experiences
that contribute to the successful completion of students' studies
and that provide examples of quality practice in early years care and education.




Procedures
----------


A potential student makes an application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


If requests for admission exceed the number of places available,
potential students will be placed on a waiting list.
The student may be contacted intermittently
to determine whether they are still interested in the place
and to give them an estimate of when the place will become available.


* Students on qualification courses must

  * meet the 'suitable person' requirements of Ofsted
  * have enhanced CRB checks carried out

* Students under the age of 17 must have their school vouch for their good character.

* We communicate a positive message to students about the value of qualifications and training.

* We ensure that trainees and students placed with us are engaged in bona fide early years training, which provides the necessary background understanding of children's development and activities.
