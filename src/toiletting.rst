Policy
------

We promote independent toileting for all children who are ready and toilet train by working with parents when the child is ready.

No child is excluded from participating in our setting who may, for any reason, not yet be toilet trained and who may still be wearing nappies or equivalent.
We work with parents towards toilet training, unless there are medical or other developmental reasons why this may not be appropriate at the time.
We make necessary adjustments to our bathroom provision and hygiene practice in order to accommodate children who are not yet toilet trained.
We see toilet training as a self-care skill that children have the opportunity to learn with the full support and non-judgemental concern of adults.


Procedures
----------


Design and fitting of W.C.s
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* All cubicles will be individual with a maximum of one toilet and one sink
* Cubicle doors will shut, but will not be able to lock from the inside or outside


Toilet training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Children are encouraged to ask a member of staff if they need to use the toilet.
* Staff closely monitor toiletting, even if the child attempts it independently.


When a child requests to use the W.C.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a child asks a member of staff to use the toilet, the staff member should:

#. Accompany that child to the nearest vacant of the *Children's W.C.s*.
#. Wait inconspicuously for the child to exit or to be available to help the child.
#. Ask whether they have flushed.
#. Supervise the child in:

 * washing their hands with soap and water,
 * drying their hands with a paper towel from the dispenser.

5. Inconspicuously check the cleanliness of the W.C.
#. Ensure that the child returns to their previous classroom.

The following rules will always be followed:

* The door to the W.C. may only be closed when no members of staff are present in the cubicle


Guardian involvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Guardians of children not yet completely toilet trained are required to provide sufficient disposable nappies and wipes for each day.


Nappy changing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Young children from two years should wear ‘pull ups’ or other types of trainer pants as soon as they are comfortable with this and their parents agree.
* Key persons undertake changing young children in their key groups; back up key persons change them if the key person is absent.
* Changing areas are warm and there are safe areas to lay young children if they need to have their bottoms cleaned.
* All children in nappies/pull-ups are checked regularly and in any case are changed every 2 1/2 hours.  If a child has a soiled or over-wet nappy in between these times, the child is changed.
* Each young child has their own tray or bag to hand with their nappies or ’pull ups’ and changing wipes.
* Gloves and aprons are put on before changing starts and the areas are prepared by, for safety reasons, placing the changing mat on the carpet mat.
  Anti-bacterial spray such as Milton is used on the changing mat between and after all nappy changes and gloves and aprons are changed in between children's changes.
* All staff are familiar with the hygiene procedures and carry these out when changing nappies.
* In addition, key persons ensure that nappy changing is relaxed and a time to promote independence in young children.
* Young children are encouraged to take an interest in using the toilet; they may just want to sit on it and talk to a friend who is also using the toilet.
* They should be encouraged to wash their hands and have soap and towels to hand.
  They should be allowed time for some play as they explore the water and the soap.
* Key persons are gentle when changing; they avoid pulling faces and making negative comments about ‘nappy contents’.
* Key persons do not make inappropriate comments about young children’s genitals when changing their nappies.
* Key persons will ensure the child is fully clean before placing a fresh nappy on and will also check to see if the child's clothes also need changing.  If clothes are soiled, they will be bagged for the parent to take home.
* Older children access the toilet when they have the need to and are encouraged to be independent.
* Nappies and ’pull ups’ are disposed of hygienically.
  Soiled and wet nappies or pull ups are bagged and put in the designated nappy bin.
  Cloth nappies, trainer pants and ordinary pants that have been wet or soiled are bagged for the parent to take home.
* *n.b.* If young children are left in wet or soiled nappies/pull-ups or clothes in the setting this may constitute neglect and will be a disciplinary matter.
  Settings have a ‘duty of care’ towards children’s personal needs.
