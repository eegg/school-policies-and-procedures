Policy
------

This setting regards snack and meal times as an important part of the setting's day.
Eating represents a social time for children and adults and helps children to learn about healthy eating.
We promote healthy eating using resources and materials from the Pre-school Learning Alliance campaign ''Feeding Young Imaginations''.
At snack and meal times, we aim to provide nutritious food, which meets the children's individual dietary needs.

With reference to hygiene:

We maintain the highest possible food hygiene standards with regard to the purchase, storage, preparation and serving of food.
We are registered as a food provider with the local authority Environmental Health Department.


Procedures
----------


Nutrition
^^^^^^^^^

We provide nutritious food for all meals and snacks, avoiding large quantities of saturated fat, sugar and salt and artificial additives, preservatives and colourings.

We include a variety of foods from the four main food groups:

 * meat, fish and protein alternatives
 * dairy foods
 * grains, cereals and starch vegetables
 * fruit and vegetables


Dietary requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Before a child starts to attend the setting, we find out from parents their children's dietary needs and preferences, including any allergies.
* We record information about each child's dietary needs in his registration record and parents sign the record to signify that it is correct.
* We regularly consult with parents to ensure that our records of their children's dietary needs are up-to-date.
  Parents sign the up-dated record to signify that it is correct.
* We display current information about individual children's dietary needs so that all staff and volunteers are fully informed about them.
* We implement systems to ensure that children receive only food and drink that is consistent with their dietary needs and preferences.
* We take care not to provide food containing nuts or nut products and are especially vigilant where we have a child who has a known allergy to nuts.
* Staff must:

 * show sensitivity in providing for children's diets and allergies
 * not use a child's diet or allergy as a label for the child
 * not make a child feel singled out because of his diet or allergy


Ethical and religious concerns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We plan children's meals in accordance with their parents' wishes.

* We provide a vegetarian option at every meal opportunity.
* Through discussion with parents and research reading by staff, we obtain information about any dietary rules abided by children and their parents.
  We take account of this information in the provision of food and drinks.


Planning of meals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We plan menus in advance, involving children and parents in the planning.
* We display the menus of meals for the information of guardians.
* We organise meal times as social occasions in which children and staff participate.


International and culturally diverse meals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We include foods from the diet of each of the children's cultural backgrounds, providing children with familiar foods and introducing them to new ones.
* We use utensils that take account of the eating practices in their cultures.

* We use meal times to help children to develop independence through making choices, serving food and drink and feeding themselves.
* We provide children with utensils that are appropriate for their ages and stages of development and 
* We have fresh drinking water constantly available for the children.
  We inform the children about how to obtain the water and that they can ask for water at any time during the day.
* We offer children present outside main hours an appropriate meal or snack.
* We inform parents who provide food for their children about the storage facilities available in the setting.
* We give parents who provide food for their children information about suitable containers for food.
* In order to protect children with food allergies, we discourage children from sharing and swapping their food with one another.
* For children who drink milk, we provide whole pasteurised milk.
* For each child under two, we provide parents with daily written information about feeding routines, intake and preferences.


Packed lunches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where children bring packed lunches, we:

* ensure perishable contents of packed lunches are refrigerated or contain an ice pack to keep food cool
* inform parents of our policy on healthy eating
* inform parents of whether we have facilities to microwave cooked food brought from home
* encourage parents to provide sandwiches with a healthy filling, fruit, and milk-based desserts where we can only provide cold food from home.
* discourage sweet drinks and can provide children with water or diluted fresh fruit juice
* discourage packed lunch contents that consist largely of crisps, processed foods, sweet drinks and sweet products such as cakes or biscuits
* reserve the right to return this food to the parent as a last resort
* provide children bringing packed lunches, with plates, cups and cutlery
* ensure staff sit with children to eat their lunch so that the mealtime is a social occasion


Hygiene
^^^^^^^

We serve meals on the basis set out in our *Nursery-Specific Policies*.

* The person in charge and the person responsible for food preparation understands the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) as it applies to their business.
  This is set out in *Safer Food, Better Business*.
  The basis for this is risk assessment as it applies to the purchase, storage, preparation and serving of food to prevent growth of bacteria and food contamination.
* All staff follow the guidelines of *Safer Food, Better Business*.
* At least one person has an in-date Food Hygiene Certificate.
* The person responsible for food preparation and serving carries out daily opening and closing checks on the kitchen to ensure standards are met consistently.
* We use reliable suppliers for the food we purchase.
* Food is stored at correct temperatures and is checked to ensure it is in-date and not subject to contamination by pests, rodents or mould.
* Packed lunches are stored in a cool place
* Un-refrigerated food is served to children within 4 hours of preparation at home.
* Food preparation areas are cleaned before use as well as after use.
* There are separate facilities for hand-washing and for washing up.
* All surfaces are clean and non-porous.
* All utensils, crockery etc are clean and stored appropriately.
* Waste food is disposed of daily.
* Cleaning materials and other dangerous materials are stored out of children's reach.
* Children do not have unsupervised access to the kitchen.
* When children take part in cooking activities, they:

 * are supervised at all times
 * understand the importance of hand washing and simple hygiene rules
 * are kept away from hot surfaces and hot water; and 
 * do not have unsupervised access to electrical equipment such as blenders


Reporting of food poisoning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Food poisoning can occur for a number of reasons.
  Not all cases of sickness or diarrhoea are as a result of food poisoning and not all cases of sickness or diarrhoea are reportable.
* Where children or adults have been diagnosed by a GP or hospital doctor to be suffering from food poisoning,
  and where it seems possible that the source of the outbreak is within the setting,
  the manager will contact the *Environmental Health Department* and the *Health Protection Agency* to report the outbreak and will comply with any investigation.
* If the food poisoning is identified as a notifiable disease under the *Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988* the setting will report the matter to Ofsted.


Breakfast, Lunch and Tea Club 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
 
|The Setting| provides the opportunity for children to have breakfast, lunch and tea. 
We do all we can to ensure that the meals provided have a suitable nutritional value. 
Children will have the opportunity throughout the sessions to visit the snack bar where fruit, other nutritional snacks and fresh water are available. 
An additional snack time will be held throughout both the morning and afternoon sessions, where milk and fruit is provided. 
Our Nursery promotes a healthy lifestyle this is reinforced through our menus and supervision over home packed lunches brought into the setting to ensure they are of nutritional value. 
As sweets can damage childrenâ€™s teeth, we do not allow sweets to be eaten in the setting.
