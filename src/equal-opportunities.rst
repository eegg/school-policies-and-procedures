Meetings and groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Once per term
`````````````

A termly meeting is held including:

* |The Equal Opportunities Officer|
* |The Setting Manager|
* Invited members of the *Equal Opportunities Working Group*

in order to:

* review the progress of actions in the `Single Equality Scheme`_ that have begun
* reassess the priority of the actions in the `Single Equality Scheme`_,
  based on the current parties to |The Setting|
* assign resources to the highest-priority actions in the updated `Single Equality Scheme`_



Every six months
````````````````

A biennial completion of
the `Equality Impact Check`_ and the `Access Audit`_
is done by the |Equal opportunities Officer|.
Shortcomings are noted as appropriate in:

* An update of the current policy
* the `Single Equality Scheme`_



Enrolment of a new child
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon the enrolment of every child,
the guardians are invited to recommend changes to the current `Single Equality Scheme`_.
If any changes are recommended,
|The Equal Opportunities Officer| adds them.


A child undertakes discrimination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We actively discourage bullying and name calling.
In the event of such activity, the parents of both children are informed immediately and we discuss appropriate action with them.
A member of staff would talk to the child and explain that the behaviour was unkind.
We would take into the account the maturity of the child.
The parent of the child would be told of his inappropriate behaviour and we would work together to remedy the situation.


Specific guidelines for each Key Equality Strand
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Enough of the abstract --
the following gives guidelines on
how equality can be implemented for each of the *Key Equality Strands*.
This is a working document,
and as such is not comprehensive,
but should be useful for consultation.


Ethnicity
`````````

* When selecting play equipment,
  it should avoid stereotyping
  and represent all `identity groups`_ fairly.


Origin
``````

* all crucial documents
  are made available in multiple languages.


Achievement
```````````

* setting suitable learning challenges;
* responding to childrenâ€™s diverse learning needs;
* overcoming potential barriers to learning and assessment for individuals and groups of children;
* providing other curricular opportunities outside the Early Years Foundation Stage to meet the needs of individuals or groups of children.

We achieve educational inclusion by continually reviewing what we do, through asking ourselves these key questions:

* do all our children achieve their best? 
* are there differences in the achievement of different groups of children? 
* what are we doing for those children who we know are not achieving their best? 
* are our actions effective? 
* are we successful in promoting racial harmony and preparing children to live in a diverse society? 

Staff ensure children:

* feel secure and know that their contributions are valued
* appreciate and value the differences they see in others
* take responsibility for their own actions
* participate safely
* are taught in groupings that allow them all to experience success
* have a common curriculum experience that allows for a range of different learning styles
* have challenging targets that enable them to succeed
* are encouraged to participate fully, regardless of disabilities or medical needs

We also make ongoing assessments of each childâ€™s progress.
Staff use this information when planning.
It enables them to take into account the abilities of all their children.
When the attainment of a child falls significantly below the expected level, staff enable the child to succeed by planning work that is in line with that childâ€™s individual needs.
Where the attainment of a child significantly exceeds the expected level of attainment, staff use appropriate resources and learning styles, and extend the breadth of work within the area or areas for which the child shows particular aptitude.


Health
``````

Physical disability
"""""""""""""""""""

When any new addition to the grounds is planned,
|The Equal Opportunities Officer| ensures that
it fully passes the `Access Audit`_.


All staff modify learning as appropriate for these children.
For example, they may give additional time to children with disabilities to complete certain activities.
In their planning teachers ensure that they give children with disabilities the opportunity to develop skills in practical aspects of the curriculum.

The *Key Person* ensures that their child's work:

* takes account of their pace of learning and the equipment they use
* takes account of the effort and concentration needed in oral work, or when using, for example, vision aids
* is adapted or offers alternative activities in those areas of learning where children are unable to manipulate tools or equipment, or use certain types of materials
* allows opportunities for them to take part in educational visits and other activities linked to their learning
* includes approaches that allow hearing-impaired children to learn about sound and music, and visually-impaired children to learn about light using visual resources and images
* uses assessment techniques that reflect their individual needs and abilities

The curriculum offered in the setting encourages children to develop positive attitudes about themselves as well as to people who are different from themselves.
It encourages children to empathise with others and to begin to develop the skills of critical thinking.
Our environment is as accessible as possible for all visitors and service users.
If access to the settings is found to treat disabled children or adults less favourably then we make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the needs of disabled children and adults.

We do this by:

* making children feel valued and good about themselves
* ensuring that children have equality of access to learning
* undertaking an access audit to establish if the setting is accessible to all children
* making adjustments to the environment and resources to accommodate a wide range of learning, physical and sensory impairments
* making appropriate provision within the curriculum to ensure each child receives the widest possible opportunity to develop their skills and abilities, e.g. recognising the different learning styles of girls and boys
* positively reflecting the widest possible range of communities in the choice of resources
* avoiding stereotypes or derogatory images in the selection of books or other visual materials
* celebrating a wide range of festivals
* creating an environment of mutual respect and tolerance
* differentiating the curriculum to meet childrenâ€™s special educational needs
* helping children to understand that discriminatory behaviour and remarks are hurtful and unacceptable
* ensuring that the curriculum offered is inclusive of children with special educational needs and children with disabilities
* ensuring that children learning English as an additional language have full access to the curriculum and are supported in their learning
* ensuring that children speaking languages other than English are supported in the maintenance and development of their home languages
