Policy
------

This setting believes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance.
We make our setting a safe and healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers.
We make children, parents and staff aware of health and safety issues.

We want our children to learn about the natural world.
Where possible, we facilitate this by contact with such,
whether through trips, visits or as pets.
This is done in accordance with hygiene and safety controls.

The Employers are committed to providing for the health, safety and welfare of all employees and to maintaining standards at least equal to the best practice in the residential and nursing home profession.

We will observe the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and all relevant regulations and codes of practice made under it from time to time. We will take into account any recommendations made by the Health and Safety Executive about health and safety issues and where appropriate will liaise with the Health and Safety Executive on particular health and safety issues which are of particular relevance to our work.

This commitment to health and safety is a management responsibility equivalent to that of any other management function. It is the duty of the employers directors to ensure that policy is upheld at all times and to provide the necessary funds and manpower required.

The employers are responsible for:

1. Assessing the risk to the health and safety of employees and others who may be affected and identifying what measures are needed to comply with its health and safety obligations.
2. Providing and maintaining locations, equipment, protective clothing and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health.
3. Ensuring that all necessary safety devices are installed and maintained on equipment.
4. Providing information, instruction, training and supervision in safe working methods and procedures.
5. Providing and maintaining a healthy and safe place of work.
6. Promoting the co-operation of employees to ensure safe and healthy conditions and systems of work by discussion and effective joint consultation
7. Establishing emergency procedures as required.
8. Monitoring and reviewing the management of health and safety at work.
9. Keeping this safety policy under review and making any revision it deems necessary from time to time. All such revisions will be brought to the attention of employees.

The above policy needs the full co-operation of all employees who are expected to give all possible assistance aimed at its successful implementation, to take reasonable care for their own safety and that of others. In order to achieve this end, every employee must:

1. Comply with any safety instructions and directions issued by the employers.
2. Take reasonable care for their health and safety and the health and safety of other persons (e.g. other employees, contractors, residents, visitors, etc.) who may be affected by your acts or omissions at work, by observing safety rules which are applicable to you.
3. Co-operate with the employers to ensure that the aims of the Health and Safety Policy Statement are achieved and any duty or requirement imposed on the employers by or under any of the relevant statutory provisions is complied with.
4. Report and co-operate in the investigation of all accidents or incidents that have led to or may have lead to injury.
5. Use equipment or protective clothing provided in accordance with the training you have received.
6. Report any potential risk or hazard or malfunction of equipment to the appropriate person.

Any failure by an employee to comply with any aspect of the employers’ health and safety procedures, rules or duties specifically assigned to the employee with regard to health and safety may be regarded as misconduct which may be dealt with as a disciplinary matter.

Although the final level of responsibility for ensuring health and safety at work lies with the managing director, each and every individual employee, certain members of management and staff have specific responsibilities to ensure that the health and safety policy is maintained at all times.

The allocation of responsibility by the employers for health and safety matters is as follows:

The Managing Director has overall and final responsibility for giving effect to this health and safety policy.

The Facilities Manager is responsible for ensuring there is consultation on health and safety matters with staff, either though representatives of recognised trade unions or through representatives of other groups of employees, as appropriate, in order to maintain health and safety at work.

The Facilities Manager is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of health and safety policies.

Managers are responsible for the implementation of the health and safety policies in the areas under their control.

All employees have the responsibility to observe all safety rules and to co-operate with the manager charged with responsibility for the implementation of the health and safety policy to achieve a healthy and safe workplace and to take reasonable care of themselves and others.


The prevention of fire is of vital importance.
Most fires are caused by carelessness and ignorance.
It is the responsibility of all personnel to become conversant with these instructions.

Upon outbreak of fire the saving and preservation of life takes precedence over the salvaging of property.
A member of staff’s first duty is to look after the children and this will mean the evacuation of the building.
No attempt should be made to fight the fire until their safety is ensured, and then without exposing any person to risk.

We ensure our premises present no risk of fire by ensuring the highest possible standard of fire precautions.
The person in charge and staff are familiar with the current legal requirements.
Where necessary we seek the advice of a competent person, such as our Fire Officer, or Fire Safety Consultant.

* Staff must be aware that there are different extinguishers for different fires
* Staff members must know the following:

  * Your means of escape, primary and secondary
  * The nearest fire alarm point
  * The locations of all *Fire Appliances*, and how they should be used
  * The location of the *Assembly Point*



Procedures
----------

* Hygiene rules relating to bodily fluids are followed with particular care and all staff are aware of how infections can be transmitted.

In the nursery we aim to: 

* Involve and motivate nursery staff in all matters concerning Health & Safety.
* Prevent accidents, injuries and ill-health and to identify and eliminate hazardous situations.
* Achieve a high standard of occupational health, safety, welfare and hygiene.
* Control situations likely to be hazardous to health and safety in the nursery or cause damage to persons or equipment.
* Provide a safe and healthy environment.



Safety of adults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Adults are provided with guidance about the safe storage, movement, lifting and erection of large pieces of equipment.
* When adults need to reach up to store equipment or to change light bulbs they are provided with safe equipment to do so.
* All warning signs are clear and in appropriate languages.
* Adults do not remain in the building on their own or leave on their own after dark.
* The sickness of staff and their involvement in accidents is recorded.
  The records are reviewed termly to identify any issues that need to be addressed.
* We keep a record of all substances that may be hazardous to health - such as cleaning chemicals, or gardening chemicals if used.
  This states what the risks are and what to do if they have contact with eyes or skin or are ingested.
  It also states where they are stored.
* We keep all cleaning chemicals in their original containers.



Designing and maintaining fixed assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   This section deals with 'fixed assets',
   which are elements of The Setting that are not easily converted to cash.
   Generally speaking, this means they are attached to the property itself and cannot move.
   See below for liquid assets.

When

1. designing, fitting, and maintaining
   an addition to or alteration of
   the property and/or its furnishings, and
2. a periodic site check is made,

the *Site Manager* ensures that

* equipment conforms to the safety regulations to which it is subject
* equipment is appropriate for the age range of children at The Setting
* equipment is laid out to allow children and staff to move freely between them
* the following table is adhered to:

=================================  =========================================================================================
Fixed asset                        Standards to which it must conform
=================================  =========================================================================================
Window                             Made safe???
Low-level window                   Made from material preventing accidental breakage
Window, first-floor or higher      Children are not able to climb through it
Door                               Fingers cannot become trapped in the frame
Floor surface                      Flat, or if uneven then predictably so, so as not to encourage tripping
Electrical socket                  One designated socket-filler; sufficient quantity to prevent overloading
Boiler                             Not accessible to children
Storage heater                     Not covered
Electrical switch gear??           Not accessible to children
Fuse box                           Not accessible to children
Fires, heaters                     Guarded
Hot water tap                      Temperature maintained to a maximum of X degrees centigrade
Property boundary                  Fenced with the exception of designated and purposeful exit points
Outdoor area                       Cleared of known poisonous organisms
Water feature, pool, pond          Has a purpose-designed cover which cannot be removed by children
=================================  =========================================================================================


Designing and maintaining movable resources (liquid assets)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   This section deals with 'liquid assets',
   which are items in The Setting that are easily exchanged for cash.
   Typically this means things in The Setting that can be moved around
   -- though use common sense; children are not a liquid asset!

When

1. purchasing an addition to The Setting's resources
2. a periodic site check is made

the *Site Manager* ensures that

* equipment conforms to the safety regulations to which it is subject
* any equipment that is sub-satisfactory is either

  1. sold, or
  2. repaired, or
  3. discarded

* equipment is appropriate for the age range of children at The Setting
* the following table is adhered to:

=================================  =========================================================================================
Liquid asset                       Standards to which it must conform
=================================  =========================================================================================
Movable resources                  Stored/stacked non-precariously
Sand                               Children's 'play sand'; clean and covered
Paint, glue                        Non-toxic
Sharp items                        A designated storage place, with the point facing the ground
=================================  =========================================================================================


Hygiene
^^^^^^^

* Our daily routines encourage the children to learn about personal hygiene.
* We have a daily cleaning routine for the setting which includes play room(s), kitchen, rest area, toilets and nappy changing areas.
* We have a schedule for cleaning resources and equipment, dressing-up clothes and furnishings.
* The toilet area has a high standard of hygiene including hand washing and drying facilities and the disposal of nappies.

We implement good hygiene practises by:

* cleaning tables between activities;
* cleaning toilets regularly;
* wearing protective clothing - such as aprons and disposable gloves - as appropriate;
* providing sets of clean clothes;
* providing tissues and wipes; and
* ensuring individual use of flannels and towels.



Risk assessing contact with organisms
`````````````````````````````````````

For all organisms that will deliberately be introduced to children or staff,
we carry out a risk assessment (see `Managing Risk <managing-risk.html>`_).
A person knowledgeable in the species
and its demands, behaviour, and `risks`_,
must have input in this.
This person may be the owner of the organism.
The risk assessment must cover:

* hygiene or safety risks,
  where necessary stipulating that

  * children wash their hands after contact


  * correct handling of the organism,
    and how this will be taught to children and staff

.. _risks: `Risks posed by organisms`_



Accidents at work
`````````````````

We have designated trained First-Aiders. Lists of First Aiders are displayed on the Employee Notice Boards, and are identified as such in the internal telephone directory.

If you suffer an accident at work, you (or someone on your behalf) must report that fact to your manager as soon as is practicable after the event. All accidents should be reported however trivial. The accident must be recorded in the appropriate Accident Book. The location of the Accident Book will depend on your place of work. Details will be displayed on the Employee Notice Board.






Fire Safety Procedures
``````````````````````

Procedures for fire and other emergency evacuation are displayed prominently in all rooms.
Fire drills are held once each term and this is recorded in our Fire Drill book.
The fire bell is rung and children are helped to put down games/activities and walked towards the door and then out to stand safely at the fence.

* Fire doors are never obstructed 
* Details are recorded in the fire drill book 

The fire procedure is displayed in the hall and all staff are familiar with the procedure Staff check all areas, pick up the register and phone and walk out with the children, where the children, staff and visitors are counted.
If necessary the fire brigade are called.
Arrangements are made to monitor the condition of all fire prevention equipment regularly.
This includes the visual inspection of fire extinguishers, and the testing of the fire alarm system.


* The basis of fire safety is risk assessment.
  These are carried out by a ‘competent person’.
* The manager has received training in fire safety sufficient to be competent to carry out risk assessment; this will be written where there are more than five staff.
  This will follow the guidance as set out in the ''Fire Safety Risk Assessment – Educational Premises'' document.
* Settings in rented premises will ensure that they have a copy of the fire safety risk assessment that applies to the building and that they contribute to regular reviews.
* Fire doors are clearly marked, never obstructed and easily opened from the inside.
* Smoke detectors/alarms and fire fighting appliances conform to BSEN standards, are fitted in appropriate high risk areas of the building and are checked as specified by the manufacturer.

Our emergency evacuation procedures are approved by the Fire Safety Officer and are:

* clearly displayed in the premises
* explained to new members of staff, volunteers and parents
* practised regularly at least once every six weeks

Records are kept of fire drills and the servicing of fire safety equipment.


Annual assessments
``````````````````

An annual risk assessment will be made by the |Health and Safety Officer|. It will:

* Identify any person especially at risk in a case of fire, and make plans to include their safe evacuation.  This includes:

 * The blind
 * The deaf
 * The otherwise disabled

* Review the evacuation plan and each room's instructions for this
* Look at the past year's records of fire practises
* Ensure the provision of adequate training
* Review the Fire Risk Assessment sheets
* Review the provision of instruction to students or visitors to the building


Staff training
``````````````

Every member of staff will receive instructions in fire precaution during induction.
The training will be recorded in the fire logbook.
All members of staff will receive refresher training every 12 months.
Students and visitors will be instructed at the beginning of their attendance.


Fire drills
```````````

Fire drills will be carried out once a term.
This will include a simulated evacuation drill.
When a fire drill is held it will be recorded in the fire logbook.


Testing of fire alarm system
````````````````````````````

The fire alarm system will be tested weekly by the *Fire Alarm Tester* and recorded in the logbook.


Emergency lighting
``````````````````

The emergency lighting will be tested each week by the *Emergency Lighting Tester* and recorded in the logbook.


Emergency exits
```````````````

All emergency exits are to be kept clear and free from obstruction at all times.


General fire safety
```````````````````

All staff will make it their responsibility to ensure:

* Their fire exit doors are unlocked when the first person arrives
* Fire doors will not be propped open
* Tops and fronts of heaters are kept clear
* There is a one-metre clearance to the routes of exit doors
* Displays where possible will not be above heaters, and if this is unavoidable they will be securely fixed
* Combustible materials (paper, card, fabrics, *etc.*) are not stored near to sockets or lights
* Unnecessary lights or electrical appliances (computers, printers, television sets, fans, laminators, *etc.*) are to be switched off and where possible unplugged
* All electrical items, plugs and cables are checked each year


Smoking
```````

Smoking is prohibited in or around the school.


In the event of a fire
``````````````````````

...


Classroom times
```````````````

Escort all children from the building.
One member of staff does this, the other to check all areas of the class, take out the register and close windows and doors if possible.
Staff will take responsibility for their own children who may have special needs.
If a small group of children are in the garden or outdoor classroom engaged in focused work with an adult, they will exit through the security side gate.
If this route is cut off to them, they will exit by the gate to the front from the outdoor classroom and wait safely with their adult outside.

If you discover a fire, your first action must be to raise the alarm.
This involves setting off any alarm, and informing any staff members, in your vicinity.
When you are alarmed of a fire or when you hear the fire alarm,
you must immediately begin the evacuation procedure as follows, with respect to your own role(s) within it:

* If you are the *Fire Procedure Coordinator*, you must:

  #. collect the register and emergency contact cards
  #. evacuate all children you are aware of to the *Assembly Point* via the *Escape Route*.
  #. Call the fire brigade by dialling 999
  #. Take the register, finishing when all members of the *Fire Procedure Subordinate Team* have reached the *Assembly Point*

* If you are a member of the *Fire Procedure Subordinate Team*, you must:

  #. make final checks in *All Areas* to ensure that no child remains behind
  #. collect any found children to you
  #. when you have completed your search, evacuate the property with your children via the *Escape Route*

Then:

  #. Attempt to extinguish the fire with the nearest suitable *Fire Appliance*, unless the fire has reached such proportions as to endanger life or escape.
  #. Close all doors and windows.
  #. All staff and children will be accounted for whilst on the drive and then taken to an indoor point of safety at the hospital directly across Oxford Road.


After the event
```````````````

* Do not re-enter the building until advised to do so by the senior fire service officer. 
* If the fire has been extinguished by school staff do not disturb any evidence which could indicate the cause of the fire.
* Ensure that the premises are in safe working order before re-occupying.


Emergency evacuation procedure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Every setting is different and the evacuation procedure will be suitable for each setting.
It must cover procedures for practice drills including:

* How children are familiar with the sound of the fire alarm.
* How the children staff and parents know where the fire exits are.
* How children are led from the building to the assembly point.
* How they will be accounted for and who by.
* How long it takes to get the children out safely.
* Who calls the emergency services and when in the event of a real fire.
* How parents are contacted.

The fire drill record book must contain:

* Date and time of the drill.
* How long it took.
* Whether there were any problems that delayed evacuation.
* Any further action taken to improve the drill procedure.


Enforcement
-----------

Our *Health and Safety Officer*
has undertaken health and safety training
and regularly updates his knowledge and understanding.

All staff are aware of potential hazards within the nursery and the surrounding environment.
We provide all staff with first aid training.

Children are made aware of health and safety issues
through discussions, planned activities and routines.
