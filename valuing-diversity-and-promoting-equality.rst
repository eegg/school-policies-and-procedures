Policy
------

We will ensure that our service is fully inclusive in meeting the needs of all children, particularly those that arise from their ethnic heritage, social and economic background, gender, ability or disability.
Our setting is committed to anti-discriminatory practice to promote equality of opportunity and valuing diversity for all children and families.

We aim to: 

* provide a secure and accessible environment in which all our children can flourish and in which all contributions are considered and valued
* include and value the contribution of all families to our understanding of equality and diversity
* provide positive non-stereotyping information about gender roles, diverse ethnic and cultural groups and disabled people
* improve our knowledge and understanding of issues of anti-discriminatory practice, promoting equality and valuing diversity
* make inclusion a thread that runs through all of the activities of the setting

*The Setting* recognises that some children and adults are treated unequally for a lot of different reasons.
We believe that this is wrong and aim to ensure that every child and adult who visits and uses our setting will feel equally welcomed, valued and respected.

Curriculum
^^^^^^^^^^

The curriculum offered in the setting encourages children to develop positive attitudes about themselves as well as to people who are different from themselves.
It encourages children to empathise with others and to begin to develop the skills of critical thinking.
Our environment is as accessible as possible for all visitors and service users.
If access to the settings is found to treat disabled children or adults less favourably then we make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the needs of disabled children and adults.

We do this by:

* making children feel valued and good about themselves
* ensuring that children have equality of access to learning
* undertaking an access audit to establish if the setting is accessible to all children
* making adjustments to the environment and resources to accommodate a wide range of learning, physical and sensory impairments
* making appropriate provision within the curriculum to ensure each child receives the widest possible opportunity to develop their skills and abilities, e.g. recognising the different learning styles of girls and boys
* positively reflecting the widest possible range of communities in the choice of resources
* avoiding stereotypes or derogatory images in the selection of books or other visual materials
* celebrating a wide range of festivals
* creating an environment of mutual respect and tolerance
* differentiating the curriculum to meet childrenâ€™s special educational needs
* helping children to understand that discriminatory behaviour and remarks are hurtful and unacceptable
* ensuring that the curriculum offered is inclusive of children with special educational needs and children with disabilities
* ensuring that children learning English as an additional language have full access to the curriculum and are supported in their learning
* ensuring that children speaking languages other than English are supported in the maintenance and development of their home languages
