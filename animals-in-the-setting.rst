Policy
------

We want our children to learn about the natural world, and where possible to do this by contact.
Contact with animals forms part of providing for this, whether through visits or as pets.
We aim to ensure that this is in accordance with sensible hygiene and safety controls.
We aim to provide our pets with an appropriately fulfilling and healthy life.


Procedures
----------

For all animals that are deliberately brought onto the setting, we:

* carry out a risk assessment with a knowledgeable person,
  accounting for any hygiene or safety risks posed by the animal,
  detailing how the animal is to be handled,
  and how any safety or hygiene issues will be addressed
* teach the children correct handling and care of the animal, and supervise them when they do so
* ensure children wash their hands after handling the animal and do not have contact with animal soil or soiled bedding
* wear disposable gloves when cleaning housing or handling soiled bedding


Pets
~~~~

We may want to keep an animal on the setting for an extended period,
even for the extent of its natural life.
When deciding upon a pet, we take account of the views of parents and children when selecting it.


On order to provide for our pets, we:

* provide suitable housing for it, and ensure this is cleaned out regularly
* ensure it is kept safely
* ensure the correct food is offered at the right times
* make arrangements for weekend and holiday care
* register with the local vet
* take out appropriate pet care health insurance
* make sure all vaccinations and other regular health measures are up-to-date and recorded
