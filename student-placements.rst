Policy
------

This setting recognises that qualifications and training make an important contribution to the quality of the care and education provided by early years settings.
As part of our commitment to quality, we offer placements to students undertaking early years qualifications and training.
We also offer placements for school pupils on work experience.
We aim to provide for students on placement with us experiences that contribute to the successful completion of their studies and that provide examples of quality practice in early years care and education.

If requests for admission exceed the number of places available you will be placed on a waiting list if a suitable place is not immediately available.
During your time on the waiting list you will be contacted from time to time to determine whether you are still interested in a place and also to give you some indication of when a place is likely to become available.

It is essential to the efficient running of the nursery and to other prospective parents/carers that you notify the nursery immediately should you make alternative childcare arrangements and no longer require a place.
Once the nursery is aware that a place is going to become available, the parents/carers at the top of the list with a child of the correct age for the vacancy will be offered that place.
Usually this will be some weeks or months in advance of the place becoming available.
On most occasions the place is accepted, when the place has been accepted a deposit of £115 must be paid to secure the child’s place but in instances where the place is not taken up and secured, it is offered to the next parent/carer on the list with a child of the appropriate age for the vacancy.



Procedures
----------

* We require students on qualification courses to meet the 'suitable person' requirements of Ofsted and have CRB checks carried out.
* We require schools placing students under the age of 17 years with the setting to vouch for their good character.
* We supervise students under the age of 17 years at all times and do not allow them to have unsupervised access to children.
* Students undertaking qualification courses who are placed in our setting on a short term basis are not counted in our staffing ratios.
* Trainee staff employed by the setting may be included in the ratios if they are deemed competent.
* We take out employers' liability insurance and public liability insurance, which covers both trainees and voluntary helpers.
* We require students to keep to our confidentiality policy.
* We co-operate with students' tutors in order to help students to fulfil the requirements of their course of study.
* We provide students, at the first session of their placement, with a short induction on how our setting is managed, how our sessions are organised and our policies and procedures.
* We communicate a positive message to students about the value of qualifications and training.
* We make the needs of the children paramount by not admitting students in numbers that hinder the essential work of the setting.
* We ensure that trainees and students placed with us are engaged in bona fide early years training, which provides the necessary background understanding of children's development and activities.

Places are offered on the following basis:

* Priority is given to:

  * those intending to use the nursery on a full-time basis.
  * parents/carers who already have one child registered at the nursery.

* Parents/carers who take up part-time places are required to provide precise information of the days when they wish to bring their child to the nursery.
* Once a child has been allocated a place on an agreed basis, it is expected that parents/carers will adhere to these arrangements.
* Failure to do so may result in termination of the contract.
