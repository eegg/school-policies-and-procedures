Policy
------

Children benefit from being taken out of the setting to go on visits or trips to local parks or other suitable venues for activities which enhance their learning experiences.
Some settings do not have direct access to outdoor provision on their premises and will need to take children out daily.
Staff in our setting ensure that there are procedures to keep children safe on outings; all staff and volunteers are aware of and follow the procedures below.


Procedures
----------

* Parents sign a general consent on registration for their children to be taken out as a part of the daily activities of the setting.
* This general consent details the venues used for daily activities.
* There is a risk assessment for each venue carried out, which is reviewed regularly.
* Parents are always asked to sign specific consent forms before major outings.
* A risk assessment is carried out before an outing takes place.
* All venue risk assessments are made available for parents to see.
* Our adult to child ratio is high, normally one adult to two children, depending on their age, sensibility and type of venue as well as how it is to be reached.
* Named children are assigned to individual staff to ensure each child is individually supervised, to ensure no child goes astray, and that there is no unauthorised access to children.
* Outings are recorded in an outings record book kept in the setting stating:

  * The date and time of outing.
  * The venue and mode of transport.
  * Names of staff assigned to named children.
  * Time of return.

* Staff take a mobile phone on outings, and supplies of tissues, wipes, pants etc as well as a mini first aid pack, snacks and water.
  The amount of equipment will vary and be consistent with the venue and the number of children as well as how long they will be out for.
* Staff take a list of children with them with contact numbers of parents/carers.
* Records are kept of the vehicles used to transport children, with named drivers and appropriate insurance cover.
* A minimum of two staff should accompany children on outings and a minimum of two should remain behind with the rest of the children.


Operational procedures for outings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same standard of care and interaction with the children is expected of staff, volunteers and students on outings.
The worker’s prime responsibility on outings is to ensure the safety of the children.
However they will expected to balance this responsibility with ensuring that children have the maximum opportunity to experience and explore new environments, to socialise and to have fun.


Types of outings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Different types of outings take place and each will require slightly different preparations and staffing levels.
These include:

* Trips on foot, e.g. visits to the park, the library, local markets and places of interest
* Trips on public transport to places like museums, farms, //etc.//


Communication with parents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parents of children taking part in an off-site activity should be provided with all appropriate information about the intended visit.
Parents must give their permission in writing before a child can be involved in any off-site activities.

Funding for off-site activities is provided mainly by parental contributions.
This must be made clear to parents in all correspondence about an educational visit at the planning stage.


Further health and safety considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All adults accompanying a party must be made aware, by the managers, of the emergency procedures which will apply.
Each adult should be provided with an emergency telephone number.
This will normally be the managers' numbers. 

Before a party leaves the nursery managers will provided a list of everyone, children and adults, travelling with the party, together with a programme and timetable for the activity. 

The safety of the party, and especially the children, is of paramount importance.
During the activity the managers must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that safety.
This involves taking note of any information provided by medical registration forms, and ensuring that children are both safe and well looked after at all times.


Visit plan
^^^^^^^^^^

The visit plan for intended educational visits must include the following:

* risk assessment
* report on preliminary visit
* applications for approval of visit
* general information
* names, ages, contact details, permission forms, medical records and other relevant details of all those going on the visit
* travel schedule
* full plan of activities
* fire precautions and evacuation procedures
* intended arrangements for supervision
* insurance arrangements for all members of the group
* emergency contacts and procedures
* general communications information
* guidance for managers
* guidance for the emergency contact and managers
* medical questionnaire returns
* first-aid boxes, inhalers and Epi-pens if needed


Visits to farms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Before a visit to a farm a risk assessment is carried out -- this may take account of safety factors listed in the farm’s own risk assessment which should be viewed.
* The outings procedure is followed.
* Children wash their hands after contact with animals.
* Outdoor footwear worn to visit farms are cleaned of mud and debris and should not be worn indoors.
