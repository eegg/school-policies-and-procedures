Policies, procedures: what's the difference?
````````````````````````````````````````````

This document operates on a distinction between the *policy* and the *procedure*.
A rough distinction is that a policy sets out a *goal*, and an associated set of procedures sets out *how the policy is to be accomplished*.

Or, to quote:

  A policy is a guiding principle used to set direction in an organization.
  A procedure is a series of steps to be followed as a consistent and repetitive approach to accomplish an end result.

  Expressed in simple terms, policies are statements of what is required in broad terms and relate to major operational issues;
  procedures are more detailed, step by step descriptions of required actions, relating to how particular processes should be carried out.
