Special Educational Need (SEN)
  Someone is considered to have a Special Educational Need if he has a significant learning difficulty in comparison to their peers,
  or experiences difficulties in learning or in adapting to a physical, social or behavioural demand of the nursery environment,
  or has a disability that hinders or prevents him from using an educational facility generally provided for the same age range.
  
  This means he needs extra special attention, and the SEN is said to remain as long as this attention is required.

Special Education Provision (SEP)
  Educational provision for a child which is additional to,
  or otherwise different from,
  the educational provision made generally for children of the age of that child.

Individual Education Plan (IEP)
  A child-specific document,
  created when the SEN is identified or suspected,
  to guide staff in helping the child to realize
  specific goals within their SEN.


Policy
------

* All SENs of children in our provision are identified early.
* We meet every SEN of children and guardians.
* We meet the specific educational needs of all children,
  irrespective of whether the need is identified as a SEN.
* Wherever possible,
  SENs are accomodated by integration into (*via* differentiation),
  rather than segregation out of,
  our curriculum.
* We work in partnership with children, guardians, and external agencies, ensuring:

  * they are updated on the stage of all processes
  * their expectations and wishes are implemented

* We respect the feelings and privacy of everyone with respect to their SENs.

Documents

SEN register
````````````

A register of all SENs is kept in *The Setting*.
This is a list of SENs, with the following attributes:

For each SEN in *The Setting*,
a separate folder is kept, divided into:

via the processes in `The Graduated Response`_.

The Graduated response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our procedures for dealing with a SEN
fit the so-called 'graduated response.'
There are two main phases to this:
an internal *identification* phase,
followed by, if supported and permitted by the guardians,
the *Early Years Action* procedures
(which incorporate *Action Plus* and Statementing).


.. _Identification:

Phase One: Identification
`````````````````````````

* A Child Progress Meeting is held after the collation of Progress Reports (see the *Record-keeping* policy).
  Here is discussed any concerns identified in the above process.
* All concerns identified in the previous Progress Report
  are monitored over the next month.
  At the next Child Progress Meeting,
  this monitoring is compared with the previous meeting's concerns.
* If concerns on the same issue are apparent in two consecutive Child Progress Meetings,
  we move to the `Early Years Action`_ phase.



.. _Early Years Action:

Phase Two: Early Years Action
`````````````````````````````

This phase has two stages --
firstly getting permission,
and secondly entering the IEP cycles.
It may be entered *via* two routes:

* culmination of the `Identification`_ phase
* initiation by a guardian of a new child at *The Setting* with a SEN

The stages are as follows:

#. The *Setting SENCO* organizes a meeting, to include:
   
   * the *Setting SENCO*
   * guardians of the child
   
   in order to discuss:
   
   * a request for the compilation of an IEP
   * the many sources of independent advice and support (via a request to the *Area SENCO*)

   * If permission is denied: we step back to the `Identification`_ stage.
   * If permission is granted: 
     
     #. The *Setting SENCO* enters the child in the SEN Register.
     #. The *Setting SENCO* and the child's *Key Person* create a new *Individual SEN folder*.
     #. The *Setting SENCO* organizes
        a meeting to include:
        
        * The *Setting SENCO*
        * All relevant *Team Leaders*
        * All *Key Persons* in *The Setting*
         
        in order to discuss:
        
        * the child's current progress
        * strategies for progress
        
     #. Move to stage 2.

#. We follow these cycles:
   
  * A six-weekly IEP-creation cycle:
  
    #. The *Setting SENCO*
       organizes a meeting with
       the guardians,
       the child's *Key Person*,
       the *Setting SENCO*,
       and, if Early Years Action Plus has begun,
       the *Area SENCO* and other recommended agencies.
       At the meeting will be discussed:
   
       * achievements in the previous IEP
       * whether, based on these achievements, we should:
         
         * move back to the `Phase One: Identification`_ stage
         * begin, or end, Early Years Action Plus procedures
         * make a request for Statutory Assessment
         * continue for another IEP-creation cycle
         
       * the composition of the next IEP
    
    #. The *Key Person*,
       *Setting SENCO*,
       and if present then the *Area SENCO* and other agencies,
       write up a review of the meeting.
    
    #. Based on the review,
       the *Key Person* and *Setting SENCO*
       then create a new IEP,
       based on the previous IEP,
       and on the child's Statement if one exists,
       comprising a list of targets which satisfy the **SMaRT** requirements:
       
       * **S** pecific: relates exclusively to the identified area of concern
       * **M** easurable: whether the target has been achieved can be identified unambiguously
       * **R** elevant: composed with the specific child and setting in mind
       * **T** ime-related: possible to achieve within the IEP-creation cycle
    
    #. The *Setting SENCO* sets a date for the next meeting.
    
    #. If it was decided that *Action Plus* would be initiated: begin the `Early Years Action Plus`_ procedures
    #. If it was decided that Statutory Assessment would be requested: begin the `Statutory Assessment`_ procedures
   
  * A daily IEP-updating cycle,
    in which the child's Key Person
    updates the current IEP.


Early Years Action Plus
```````````````````````

If *Action Plus* is agreed to:

#. The *Setting SENCO* and the guardians sign an `Action permission form`_
#. The *Setting SENCO* contacts the *Area SENCO*.


Statutory Assessment
````````````````````

If a *Statutory Assessment* is to be requested:

#. The *Setting SENCO* and the guardians sign an `Action Plus permission form`_
#. The *Setting SENCO* contacts the *Area SENCO*.


Enforcement
-----------

The *Setting SENCO* can train other *Staff Members*.
