Policy
------

This setting believes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance.
We make our setting a safe and healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers.
We make children, parents and staff aware of health and safety issues.

We want our children to learn about the natural world.
Where possible, we facilitate this by contact with such,
whether through trips, visits or as pets.
This is done in accordance with hygiene and safety controls.

The Employers are committed to providing for the health, safety and welfare of all employees and to maintaining standards at least equal to the best practice in the residential and nursing home profession.

We will observe the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and all relevant regulations and codes of practice made under it from time to time. We will take into account any recommendations made by the Health and Safety Executive about health and safety issues and where appropriate will liaise with the Health and Safety Executive on particular health and safety issues which are of particular relevance to our work.

This commitment to health and safety is a management responsibility equivalent to that of any other management function. It is the duty of the employers directors to ensure that policy is upheld at all times and to provide the necessary funds and manpower required.

The employers are responsible for:



1. Assessing the risk to the health and safety of employees and others who may be affected and identifying what measures are needed to comply with its health and safety obligations.


2. Providing and maintaining locations, equipment, protective clothing and systems of work that are safe and without risks to health.


3. Ensuring that all necessary safety devices are installed and maintained on equipment.


4. Providing information, instruction, training and supervision in safe working methods and procedures.


5. Providing and maintaining a healthy and safe place of work.


6. Promoting the co-operation of employees to ensure safe and healthy conditions and systems of work by discussion and effective joint consultation


7. Establishing emergency procedures as required.


8. Monitoring and reviewing the management of health and safety at work.


9. Keeping this safety policy under review and making any revision it deems necessary from time to time. All such revisions will be brought to the attention of employees.



The above policy needs the full co-operation of all employees who are expected to give all possible assistance aimed at its successful implementation, to take reasonable care for their own safety and that of others. In order to achieve this end, every employee must:



1. Comply with any safety instructions and directions issued by the employers.


2. Take reasonable care for their health and safety and the health and safety of other persons (e.g. other employees, contractors, residents, visitors, etc.) who may be affected by your acts or omissions at work, by observing safety rules which are applicable to you.


3. Co-operate with the employers to ensure that the aims of the Health and Safety Policy Statement are achieved and any duty or requirement imposed on the employers by or under any of the relevant statutory provisions is complied with.


4. Report and co-operate in the investigation of all accidents or incidents that have led to or may have lead to injury.


5. Use equipment or protective clothing provided in accordance with the training you have received.


6. Report any potential risk or hazard or malfunction of equipment to the appropriate person.



Any failure by an employee to comply with any aspect of the employersâ€™ health and safety procedures, rules or duties specifically assigned to the employee with regard to health and safety may be regarded as misconduct which may be dealt with as a disciplinary matter.

Although the final level of responsibility for ensuring health and safety at work lies with the managing director, each and every individual employee, certain members of management and staff have specific responsibilities to ensure that the health and safety policy is maintained at all times.

The allocation of responsibility by the employers for health and safety matters is as follows:

The Managing Director has overall and final responsibility for giving effect to this health and safety policy.

The Facilities Manager is responsible for ensuring there is consultation on health and safety matters with staff, either though representatives of recognised trade unions or through representatives of other groups of employees, as appropriate, in order to maintain health and safety at work.

The Facilities Manager is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of health and safety policies.

Managers are responsible for the implementation of the health and safety policies in the areas under their control.

All employees have the responsibility to observe all safety rules and to co-operate with the manager charged with responsibility for the implementation of the health and safety policy to achieve a healthy and safe workplace and to take reasonable care of themselves and others.

Accident Book
`````````````

A book listing accidents, organized by date and time, with the following attributes:

* Date and time
* ...


Procedures
----------

* Hygiene rules relating to bodily fluids are followed with particular care and all staff are aware of how infections can be transmitted.

In the nursery we aim to: 

* Involve and motivate nursery staff in all matters concerning Health & Safety.
* Prevent accidents, injuries and ill-health and to identify and eliminate hazardous situations.
* Achieve a high standard of occupational health, safety, welfare and hygiene.
* Control situations likely to be hazardous to health and safety in the nursery or cause damage to persons or equipment.

An accident happens
```````````````````

When a child has an accident in the care of The Setting:

* The child's Key Person records all details in the `Accident Book`_.
* When the child is collected,
  the child's Key Person notifies the collector,
  and asks the collector to sign in the Accident Book.


Safety of adults
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Adults are provided with guidance about the safe storage, movement, lifting and erection of large pieces of equipment.
* When adults need to reach up to store equipment or to change light bulbs they are provided with safe equipment to do so.
* All warning signs are clear and in appropriate languages.
* Adults do not remain in the building on their own or leave on their own after dark.
* The sickness of staff and their involvement in accidents is recorded.
  The records are reviewed termly to identify any issues that need to be addressed.
* We keep a record of all substances that may be hazardous to health - such as cleaning chemicals, or gardening chemicals if used.
  This states what the risks are and what to do if they have contact with eyes or skin or are ingested.
  It also states where they are stored.
* We keep all cleaning chemicals in their original containers.



Designing and maintaining fixed assets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   This section deals with 'fixed assets',
   which are elements of The Setting that are not easily converted to cash.
   Generally speaking, this means they are attached to the property itself and cannot move.
   See below for liquid assets.

When

1. designing, fitting, and maintaining
   an addition to or alteration of
   the property and/or its furnishings, and
2. a periodic site check is made,

the *Site Manager* ensures that

* equipment conforms to the safety regulations to which it is subject
* equipment is appropriate for the age range of children at The Setting
* equipment is laid out to allow children and staff to move freely between them
* the following table is adhered to:

=================================  =========================================================================================
Fixed asset                        Standards to which it must conform
=================================  =========================================================================================
Window                             Made safe???
Low-level window                   Made from material preventing accidental breakage
Window, first-floor or higher      Children are not able to climb through it
Door                               Fingers cannot become trapped in the frame
Floor surface                      Flat, or if uneven then predictably so, so as not to encourage tripping
Electrical socket                  One designated socket-filler; sufficient quantity to prevent overloading
Boiler                             Not accessible to children
Storage heater                     Not covered
Electrical switch gear??           Not accessible to children
Fuse box                           Not accessible to children
Fires, heaters                     Guarded
Hot water tap                      Temperature maintained to a maximum of X degrees centigrade
Property boundary                  Fenced with the exception of designated and purposeful exit points
Outdoor area                       Cleared of known poisonous organisms
Water feature, pool, pond          Has a purpose-designed cover which cannot be removed by children
=================================  =========================================================================================


Designing and maintaining moveable resources (liquid assets)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. container:: explanation

   This section deals with 'liquid assets',
   which are items in The Setting that are easily exchanged for cash.
   Typically this means things in The Setting that can be moved around
   -- though use common sense; children are not a liquid asset!

When

1. purchasing an addition to The Setting's resources
2. a periodic site check is made

the *Site Manager* ensures that

* equipment conforms to the safety regulations to which it is subject
* any equipment that is sub-satisfactory is either

  1. sold, or
  2. repaired, or
  3. discarded

* equipment is appropriate for the age range of children at The Setting
* the following table is adhered to:

=================================  =========================================================================================
Liquid asset                       Standards to which it must conform
=================================  =========================================================================================
Moveable resources                 Stored/stacked non-precariously
Sand                               Children's 'play sand'; clean and covered
Paint, glue                        Non-toxic
Sharp items                        A designated storage place, with the point facing the ground
=================================  =========================================================================================


Hygiene
^^^^^^^

* Our daily routines encourage the children to learn about personal hygiene.
* We have a daily cleaning routine for the setting which includes play room(s), kitchen, rest area, toilets and nappy changing areas.
* We have a schedule for cleaning resources and equipment, dressing-up clothes and furnishings.
* The toilet area has a high standard of hygiene including hand washing and drying facilities and the disposal of nappies.

We implement good hygiene practices by:

* cleaning tables between activities;
* cleaning toilets regularly;
* wearing protective clothing - such as aprons and disposable gloves - as appropriate;
* providing sets of clean clothes;
* providing tissues and wipes; and
* ensuring individual use of flannels and towels.



Risk assessing contact with organisms
`````````````````````````````````````

For all organisms that will deliberately be introduced to children or staff,
we carry out a risk assessment (see `Managing Risk <managing-risk.html>`_).
A person knowledgeable in the species
and its demands, behaviour, and `risks`_,
must have input in this.
This person may be the owner of the organism.
The risk assessment must cover:

* hygiene or safety risks,
  where necessary stipulating that

  * children wash their hands after contact


  * correct handling of the organism,
    and how this will be taught to children and staff

.. _risks: `Risks posed by organisms`_



Accidents at work
-----------------

We have designated trained First-Aiders. Lists of First Aiders are displayed on the Employee Notice Boards, and are identified as such in the internal telephone directory.

If you suffer an accident at work, you (or someone on your behalf) must report that fact to your manager as soon as is practicable after the event. All accidents should be reported however trivial. The accident must be recorded in the appropriate Accident Book. The location of the Accident Book will depend on your place of work. Details will be displayed on the Employee Notice Board.



Enforcement
-----------

Our *Health and Safety Officer*
has undertaken health and safety training
and regularly updates his knowledge and understanding.

All staff are aware of potential hazards within the nursery and the surrounding environment.
We provide all staff with first aid training.

Children are made aware of health and safety issues
through discussions, planned activities and routines.
