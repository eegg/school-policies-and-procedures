<p>We believe that children benefit most when guardians and settings work together in partnership.
Our aim is to support guardians as partners in educating their children and in the full life of the setting.
We also aim to support guardians in their own education and development.</p>
<p>Some guardians are less well represented in early years settings.
These include fathers, guardians living apart from their children but involved in their lives, and working guardians.
We will ensure all parents are included.
This means taking different strategies for involving differet types of guardian.</p>

<li>We ensure ongoing dialogue with parents to improve our knowledge of the needs of their children and to support their families.</li>
<li>We inform all parents about how the setting is run and its policies through access to written information and through regular informal communication.
We check to ensure parents understand the information that is given to them.</li>
<li>We encourage and support parents to play an active part in the governance and management of the setting.</li>
<li>We inform all parents on a regular basis about their children's progress.</li>
<li>We involve parents in the shared written record keeping about their children and their developmental records.</li>
<li>We provide opportunities for parents to contribute their own skills, knowledge and interests to the activities of the setting.</li>
<li>We inform parents about relevant conferences, workshops and training.</li>
<li>We consult with parents about the times of meetings to avoid excluding anyone.</li>
<li>We provide information about opportunities to be involved in the setting in ways that are accessible to parents with basic skills needs, or those for whom English is an additional language.</li>
<li>We hold meetings in venues that are accessible and appropriate for all.</li>
<li>We welcome the contributions of parents, in whatever form these may take.</li>
<li>We inform all parents of the systems for registering queries, complaints or suggestions and check to ensure these are understood.</li>
