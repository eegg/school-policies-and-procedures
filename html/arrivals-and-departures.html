</div>
<p>We aim to make arrivals and departures:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>quick</li>
<li>efficient</li>
<li>stress-free</li>
<li>accurately recorded and, above all, safe</li>
</ul>
<p>It is essential that guardians always sign their children in and record the time of arrival on the daily arrivals and departures sheet.
The time is defined by the clock in the entrance hallway.</p>
<p>In the event that a child is not collected by an authorised adult at the end of a session/day, the setting puts into practice agreed procedures.
These ensure the child is cared for safely by an experienced and qualified practitioner who is known to the child.
We will ensure that the child receives a high standard of care in order to cause as little distress as possible.</p>
<p>We inform parents/carers of our procedures so that, if they are unavoidably delayed, they will be reassured that their children will be properly cared for.</p>
<p>The setting closes promptly.</p>

<h1>Procedures</h1>
<div class="section" id="determining-the-time">
<h2>Determining the time</h2>
<p>In order that the actions of all staff and guardians are properly synchronized,
everyone determines the time by the <em>Authoritative Clocks</em>, which we provide such that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>they are displayed above the signing in table and checked for accuracy on a daily basis</li>
<li>they are visible to guardians from outside Lexden Montessori</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arrivals">
<h2>Arrivals</h2>
<p>Guardians must follow the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The guardian must wait until the defined start of their booked session before they enter the property</li>
<li>At the start time of the booked session, the guardian must signal their arrival at the <em>Setting Entrance</em></li>
<li>They must only enter the property when a <em>Staff Member</em> opens the door to them.</li>
<li>The child is surrendered to the care of his <em>Key Person</em> and the guardian says Goodbye to the child.</li>
<li>The parent signs the <em>Arrivals Sheet</em>, marking the time by the <em>Authoritative Clock</em></li>
<li>The parent exits the property via the <em>Setting Entrance</em> using the following procedure</li>
</ol>
<p>The <em>Security Staff Member</em> will always be at the door, to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ensure anyone entering is permitted to do so</li>
<li>ensure that the door is closed securely after each exit and arrival</li>
<li>ensure the safeguarding of all children</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Guardians are not permitted to open the entrance door to other guardians except with the immediate prior consent of the Security Staff.</li>
<li>On arrival at the nursery a child will remain the responsibility of the guardian until they have been signed in.</li>
<li>The responsibility will be handed back to the guardian at the point of signing out on departure.</li>
<li>When collecting a child we do not permit any guardian to exit unannounced.</li>
<li>To avoid disruption to our daily routine, guardians are requested that their child is present by the start of their booked session.</li>
<li>We have the right to refuse admission if parents come late, which, except at the Manager's discretion, will be enforced on any guardian late by more than ten minutes.</li>
<li>Any collector of the child must be entered into the additional collector’s section of the enrolment form by a guardian of that child prior to collection.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uncollected-children">
<h2>Uncollected children</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Parents of children starting at the setting are asked to provide the following specific information which is recorded on our Registration Form:<ul>
<li>Home address and telephone number - if the parents do not have a telephone, an alternative number must be given, perhaps a neighbour or close relative.</li>
<li>Place of work, address and telephone number (if applicable).</li>
<li>Mobile telephone number (if applicable).</li>
<li>Names, addresses, telephone numbers, photographs and signatures of adults who are authorised by the parents to collect their child from the setting, for example a childminder or grandparent.</li>
<li>Who has parental responsibility for the child.</li>
<li>Information about any person who does not have legal access to the child.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On occasions when parents are aware that they will not be at home or in their usual place of work, they inform us in writing of how they can be contacted.</li>
<li>On occasions when parents or the persons normally authorised to collect the child are not able to collect the child, they provide us with written details of the name, address and telephone number of the person who will be collecting their child. We agree with parents how to verify the identity of the person who is to collect their child.</li>
<li>Parents are informed that if they are not able to collect the child as planned, they must inform us so that we can begin to take back-up measures. We provide parents with our contact telephone number.</li>
<li>We inform parents that we apply our child protection procedures as set out in our child protection policy in the event that their children are not collected from setting by an authorised adult within one hour after the setting has closed and the staff can no longer supervise the child on our premises.</li>
<li>If a child is not collected at the end of the session/day, we follow the following procedures:<ul>
<li>The child’s file is checked for any information about changes to the normal collection routines.</li>
<li>If no information is available, parents/carers are contacted at home or at work.</li>
<li>If this is unsuccessful, the adults who are authorised by the parents to collect their child from the setting - and whose telephone numbers are recorded on the Registration Form - are contacted.</li>
<li>All reasonable attempts are made to contact the parents or nominated carers.</li>
<li>The child does not leave the premises with anyone other than those named on the Registration Form or in their file.</li>
<li>If no-one collects the child after one hour and there is no-one who can be contacted to collect the child, we apply the procedures for uncollected children.</li>
<li>We contact our local authority children’s social services care team:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The child stays at setting in the care of two fully-vetted workers until the child is safely collected either by the parents or by a social care worker.</li>
<li>Social Care will aim to find the parent or relative if they are unable to do so, the child will become looked after by the local authority.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances do staff to go to look for the parent, nor do they take the child home with them.</li>
<li>A full written report of the incident is recorded in the child’s file.</li>
<li>Depending on circumstances, we reserve the right to charge parents for the additional hours worked by our staff.</li>
<li>Ofsted may be informed.</li>
<li>Any guardian who is late collecting their child will have to pay for all extra time at the <em>Unbooked Childcare Rate</em>.</li>
