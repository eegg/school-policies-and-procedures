<h1>Policy</h1>
<p>All employees (regardless of length of service) have the right to take a reasonable period of unpaid time off work to deal with an unexpected emergency or sudden problem involving a dependant, and not to be dismissed or victimised for doing so. The right, however, does not cover time off to deal with other emergencies, for example, dealing with a leaking washing machine.</p>
<p>This policy summarises the employers rules and procedures in relation to this statutory right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-is-time-off-available">
<h1>When is time off available?</h1>
<p>You may take a reasonable amount of unpaid time off work during your normal working hours in order to take action that is necessary for dealing with the following unexpected or sudden situations:-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to provide assistance when a dependant falls ill, gives birth or is injured or assaulted;</li>
<li>to make arrangements for the provision of care for a dependant who is ill or injured;</li>
<li>to deal with the death of a dependant, including to make funeral arrangements and to attend the funeral;</li>
<li>to deal with an unexpected disruption or breakdown in care arrangements for a dependant – for example when your child minder or nanny fails to turn up;</li>
<li>to deal with an incident involving your child during school hours – for example if your child has had an accident at school.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-you-must-do-to-have-time-off">
<h1>What you must do to have time off</h1>
<p>Your right to time off does not apply unless you:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>tell your Manager the reason for your absence as soon as reasonably practicable, and</li>
<li>tell your Manager how long you expect to be absent, unless this is impossible until you have returned to work.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you know in advance that you are going to need time off, you should ask for holiday leave in the usual way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-is-a-dependant">
<h1>Who is a dependant?</h1>
<p>A ‘dependant’ includes your partner, child or parent, or someone else who lives with you as part of your family. For example, this could be an elderly aunt or grandparent who lives with you. A dependant does not include your tenant, boarder or lodger living in your family home, or anyone else who lives in your household as an employee, e.g. a nanny or housekeeper.</p>
<p>In addition ‘dependant’ includes any person who reasonably relies on you either for assistance on an occasion when the person falls ill or is injured or assaulted, or to make arrangements for the provision of their care in the event of illness or injury.</p>
<p>Where time off relates to unexpected disruption or termination of arrangements for the care of a dependant, then a dependant will also include any person who reasonably relies on you to make arrangements for their provision of care. For example this wider category of dependants can include a relative who lives nearby – and whom you look after outside work -and then falls ill unexpectedly, or an elderly neighbour living alone who falls and breaks her leg.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-much-time-off-is-allowed">
<h1>How much time off is allowed?</h1>
<p>There is no set limit to the amount of time that can be taken off by you, but it must be reasonable. What is reasonable will depend on the circumstances of the emergency or problem. In most cases we would expect the time off to be for a few hours, and, at the very most, one or two days to allow you to deal with the immediate emergency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complaints">
<h1>Complaints</h1>
<p>If you think you have been unreasonably refused time off, or victimised for taking it, you should follow our Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>In cases where an employee has abused their right to take time off, we may treat such conduct as a disciplinary offence and ask the employee to attend a disciplinary hearing. In appropriate cases, dismissal of the employee may result.</p>
