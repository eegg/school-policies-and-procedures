<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Policy</a></h1>
<p>This setting believes that the health and safety of children is of paramount importance.
We make our setting a safe and healthy place for children, parents, staff and volunteers by assessing and minimising the hazards and risks to enable the children to thrive in a healthy and safe environment.</p>
<p>The basis of this policy is risk assessment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="procedures">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Procedures</a></h1>
<p>Our risk assessments follow five steps as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Identification of risk.</strong>
Where is it and what is it?</li>
<li><strong>Who is at risk?</strong>
Childcare staff, children, parents, cooks, cleaners?</li>
<li><strong>Risk level.</strong>
High, medium, low?
This is both the risk of the likelihood of it happening, as well as the possible impact if it did.</li>
<li><strong>Control measures.</strong>
What will you need to do, or ensure others will do, in order to reduce or eliminate that risk?</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and review.</strong>
How do you know if what you have said is working, or is thorough enough? If it is not working, it will need to be amended, or maybe there is a better solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our risk assessment process covers adults and children and includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>checking for and noting hazards and risks indoors and outside, and in our premises and for activities;</li>
<li>assessing the level of risk and who might be affected;</li>
<li>deciding which areas need attention; and</li>
<li>developing an action plan that specifies the action required, the time-scales for action, the person responsible for the action and any funding required.</li>
<li>Where more than five staff and volunteers are employed the risk assessment is written and is reviewed regularly.</li>
<li>We maintain lists of health and safety issues, which are checked daily before the session begins as well as those that are checked on a weekly and termly basis when a full risk assessment is carried out.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="particular-risk-assessments">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Particular risk assessments</a></h2>
<p>We maintain a list of risk assessments for activities that we take part in.
