<h1>Policy</h1>
<p>The employers are committed to ensure that no harassment or victimisation at work is overlooked or condoned. Harassment can take many forms. It can range from extreme forms such as bullying and violence, to less obvious actions like ignoring someone at work. Whatever the form of harassment, it will be unwanted behaviour, which is unwelcome and unpleasant. Single or continued acts may constitute harassment and will normally be considered as a serious disciplinary matter. Any recipients of harassment should contact in confidence their manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sexual-harassment-at-work">
<h1>Sexual harassment at work</h1>
<p>Sexual harassment is conduct directed towards an employee by another employee or group of employees which is of a sexual nature, or which is based on a person’s sex, and which is regarded as unwelcome or offensive by the recipient. The following examples illustrate conduct, which may be regarded as sexual harassment:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>unwanted physical contact;</li>
<li>unwelcome sexual advances, propositions, suggestions or pressure for sexual activity, at or outside work, particularly where it has been made clear that this is not welcome;</li>
<li>conduct which is intimidatory, physically or verbally abusive, including the display of sexually explicit material in the workplace;</li>
<li>derogatory or demeaning remarks based on gender; and</li>
<li>suggestions that sexual favours may further an employee’s career, or that refusal may hinder it.</li>
</ol>
<p>We regard sexual harassment as a form of intimidation which has the effect of insulting and demeaning the employee against whom it is perpetrated. It is therefore unacceptable in the working environment and we will take positive action to prevent its occurrence.</p>
<p>Employees are encouraged to resolve a situation of harassment informally, by talking directly, politely and unambiguously to the person concerned. However, if this is not possible, or does not have the desired effect, then the employee should invoke the Grievance Procedure. Depending on the seriousness of the allegation, the alleged perpetrator may be suspended on full pay while the matter is being investigated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="investigation">
<h1>Investigation</h1>
<p>(Employees are reminded that they must raise a formal grievance if they wish to rely on the facts of the complaint in relation to a subsequent employment tribunal claim.)</p>
<p>When an employee makes an allegation of harassment this will be fully investigated, normally by an employee of the same sex as the complainant. As far as possible, confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigative process. It is emphasised that neither complainant nor accused will be victimised in any way. However any malicious complaints may result in disciplinary action against the complainant.</p>
<p>If relevant, witnesses will be interviewed and a report will be prepared for a senior manager to decide the appropriate action, which may be disciplinary action, dismissal, a job transfer or counselling. The alleged victim will be informed of the outcome as part of the Grievance Procedure.</p>
