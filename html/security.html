<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Policy statement</a></h1>
<p>We maintain the highest possible security of our premises to ensure that each child is safely cared for during their time with us.</p>
<p>Children’s safety is maintained as the highest priority at all times both on and off premises.
Every attempt is made through carrying out the outings procedure and the exit/entrance procedure to ensure the security of children is maintained at all times.
In the unlikely event of a child going missing, our missing child procedure is followed.</p>
<p>Missing child incidents are very worrying for all concerned.
Part of managing the incident is to try to keep everyone as calm as possible.
The staff will feel worried about the child, especially the key person or the designated carer responsible for the safety of that child for the outing.
They may blame themselves and their feelings of anxiety and distress will rise as the length of time the child is missing increases.
Staff may be the understandable target of parental anger and they may be afraid.</p>
<p>The parents will feel angry, and fraught.
They may want to blame staff and may single out one staff member over others.
They may direct their anger at the setting leader.</p>
<p>The other children are also sensitive to what is going on around them.
They too may be worried.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Child going missing on an outing</a></h2>
<p>This describes what to do when staff have taken a small group on an outing, leaving the setting leader and/or other staff back in the setting.
If the setting Leader has accompanied children on the outing, the procedures are adjusted accordingly.
What to do when a child goes missing from a whole setting outing may be a little different, as parents usually attend and are responsible for their own child.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>As soon as it is noticed that a child is missing, staff on the outing ask children to stand with their designated person and carry out a headcount to ensure that no other child has gone astray.
One staff member searches the immediate vicinity but does not search beyond that.</li>
<li>The setting leader or manager is contacted immediately and the incident is reported.</li>
<li>The setting leader contacts the police and reports the child as missing.</li>
<li>The setting leader contacts the parent, who makes their way to the setting or outing venue as agreed with the setting leader.
The setting is advised as the best place, as by the time the parent arrives, the child may have been returned to the setting.</li>
<li>Staff take the remaining children back to the setting.</li>
<li>In an indoor venue, the staff contact the venue’s security who will handle the search and contact the police if the child is not found.</li>
<li>The setting leader contacts the chairperson and reports the incident.
The chairperson, with the management committee, (or proprietor) carries out an investigation and may come to the setting immediately.</li>
<li>The setting leader, or designated staff member may be advised by the police to stay at the venue until they arrive.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-investigation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">The investigation</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Staff keep calm and do not let the other children become anxious or worried.</li>
<li>The setting leader together with the chairperson or representative from the management committee or owner, speaks with the parent(s).</li>
<li>The chairperson and management committee or owner, carry out a full investigation taking written statements from all the staff in the room or who were on the outing.</li>
<li>The key person/staff member writes an incident report detailing:<ul>
<li>The date and time of the report.</li>
<li>What staff/children were in the group/outing and the name of the staff designated responsible for the missing child.</li>
<li>When the child was last seen in the group/outing.</li>
<li>What has taken place in the group or outing since the child went missing.</li>
<li>The time it is estimated that the child went missing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A conclusion is drawn as to how the breach of security happened.</li>
<li>If the incident warrants a police investigation, all staff co-operate fully.
In this case, the police will handle all aspects of the investigation, including interviewing staff.
Children’s Social Care may be involved if it seems likely that there is a child protection issue to address.</li>
<li>The incident is reported under RIDDOR arrangements (see the Reporting of Accidents and Incidents policy).
The local authority Health and Safety Officer may want to investigate and will decide if there is a case for prosecution.</li>
<li>In the event of disciplinary action needing to be taken, Ofsted is informed.</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Managing people</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Setting leaders need to ensure that staff under investigation are not only fairly treated but receive support while feeling vulnerable.</li>
<li>When dealing with a distraught and angry parent, there should always be two members of staff:<ul>
<li>one of whom is the setting leader</li>
<li>the other should be the chairperson of the management committee or representative, or the proprietor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Aggression or threats against staff are not tolerated, and the police should be called.</li>
<li>The remaining staff caring for the children need to be focused on their needs and must not discuss the incident in front of them.
They should answer children’s questions honestly but also reassure them.</li>
<li>In accordance with the severity of the final outcome, staff may need counselling and support.
If a child is not found, or is injured, or worse, this will be a very difficult time.
The chairperson or proprietor will use their discretion to decide what action to take.</li>
<li>Staff must not discuss any missing child incident with the press without taking advice.</li>

<div class="section" id="missing-children-during-outings">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Missing children during outings</a></h2>
<p>Off-site visits are activities arranged by or on behalf of the nursery, and which take place outside the nursery grounds.
The managers and nursery staff believe that off-site activities can supplement and enrich the curriculum of the nursery by providing experiences which would otherwise be impossible.
All off-site activities must serve an educational purpose, enhancing and enriching our children’s learning experiences.</p>
<p>In this policy we seek to establish a clear and coherent structure for the planning and evaluation of our off-site visits.
We ensure that any risks are managed and kept to a minimum, for the safety and health of all children at all times.
Within these limits we seek to make our visits available to all pupils, and wherever possible to make them accessible to those with disabilities.
The visits usually take place within the nursery day.</p>
<p>We aim to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>enhance curricular and recreational opportunities for our children</li>
<li>provide a wider range of experiences for our children than could be provided on the nursery site alone</li>
<li>promote the independence of our children as learners, and enable them to grow and develop in new learning environments</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim to organise more formal outings at least once a term.
Charges for these outings, if applicable, will be notified to parents/carers in advance of the outing and will be payable before the outing.
It is hoped that these outings will enhance and re-enforce, in a practical way, what your child is learning in the nursery.
Risk Assessment will be carried out by managers prior to the visit and first aid equipment will be taken on the day.
We will ask parents/carers to sign a consent form in advance of such outings and will offer opportunities for parents/carers to accompany their child and the nursery on the outing.</p>
<p>The nursery’s managers are involved in the planning and management of off-site visits.</p>
<p>The Managers will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ensure that risk assessments are completed</li>
<li>assign competent staff to lead and help with trips</li>
<li>organise related staff training</li>
<li>verify that all accompanying adults, including private car/coach drivers, have had satisfactory police checks</li>
<li>make sure that all necessary permissions and medical forms are obtained</li>
<li>keep records of visits, and ensure there are regular generic assessments of the risks (for example road-crossing) where there are frequent visits to local venues (for example a park)</li>
</ul>
<p>All off-site activities must take place in accordance with the LEA’s instructions.
It is our policy that all children should be able to participate in educational visits.
Where a child with a disability is eligible for a trip, we will make every effort to ensure that he is included.
We may seek guidance from parents to help us adapt our programme, and we will make any reasonable adjustments to our itinerary to include a child with disabilities.
Any such adjustments will be included in the risk assessment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-a-child-is-lost-on-an-outing">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Where a child is lost on an outing</a></h2>
<p>If the Nursery’s policies and procedures are being observed the likelihood of a child being lost is small.
Very occasionally a child may become separated from the group on an outing or become lost.
With careful planning and co-operative working amongst staff, children should not be out of sight of an adult during an outing.</p>
<p>If it is realised that a child is no longer with the group:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Staff should look carefully all around without leaving the group</li>
<li>That staff member's key children should be re-allocated to other members of staff</li>
<li>The Nursery managers will contact the parents immediately</li>
<li>The police will be informed and all the children will be returned to the Nursery</li>
<li>At the end of the day the managers will complete an incident report</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outings-and-lost-children-policy">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Outings and lost children policy</a></h2>
<p>The Nursery is committed to ensuring all children are taken out at least two to three times a week, and subject to staff ratio and weather permitting, once a day.
It is expected that children will arrive at the nursery dressed appropriately for the weather.
We aim to organise more formal outings at least once a term.
Charges for these outings, if applicable, will be notified to parents/carers in advance of the outing and will be billed on a term basis in arrears.
It is hoped that these outings will enhance and re-enforce, in a practical way, what your child is learning in the nursery.
First aid equipment will be taken.
We will ask parents/carers to sign a consent form in advance of such outings.</p>
<p>After a thorough search of the premises inside and out the police would be notified and the children’s parents called immediately.</p>
<p>The Nursery school will ensure that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All children are supervised by adults at all times and will always be in sight of an adult</li>
<li>Adults do not walk about with hot drinks or place hot drinks in reach of children</li>
<li>A register of both adults and children is completed on arrival so that a complete record of all those present is available in an emergency</li>
<li>Children do not have unsupervised access to kitchens, cookers or any cupboards storing hazardous materials including matches.</li>
<li>Children will only leave the group with authorised adults</li>
<li>A correctly stocked and locked first aid box is available at all times</li>
<li>Safety checks on premises both inside and outside are made before everyday/session</li>
<li>The outdoor space is securely fenced</li>
<li>Equipment is checked regularly and any dangerous items are repaired and discarded</li>
<li>Activities such as cooking, woodwork, and energetic play receive close and constant supervision</li>
<li>The layout and space ratios allow children and adults to move safely and freely between activities</li>
<li>Equipment offered to children is developmentally appropriate; recognising that materials suitable for older children may pose a risk to younger/less mature children</li>
<li>On outings the adult/child ratio will be at least 1:2</li>
