<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Policy</a></h1>
<p><em>The Setting</em> endeavours that <em>Discrimination</em> does not exist.</p>
<p>We will ensure that our service is fully inclusive in meeting the needs of all children, particularly those that arise from their ethnic heritage, social and economic background, gender, ability or disability.
Our setting is committed to anti-discriminatory practice to promote equality of opportunity and valuing diversity for all children and families.</p>
<p>We aim to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provide a secure and accessible environment in which all our children can flourish and in which all contributions are considered and valued</li>
<li>include and value the contribution of all families to our understanding of equality and diversity</li>
<li>provide positive non-stereotyping information about gender roles, diverse ethnic and cultural groups and disabled people</li>
<li>improve our knowledge and understanding of issues of anti-discriminatory practice, promoting equality and valuing diversity</li>
<li>make inclusion a thread that runs through all of the activities of the setting</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Setting</em> recognises that some children and adults are treated unequally for a lot of different reasons.
We believe that this is wrong and aim to ensure that every child and adult who visits and uses our setting will feel equally welcomed, valued and respected.</p>
<p>The employers’ are equal opportunity employers who are committed to ensuring within the framework of the law that its workplaces are free from unlawful or unfair discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, nationality, ethnic or national origin, sex, gender (including gender reassignment), sexual orientation, religion or belief reassignment, [age], marital status or physical or mental disability.</p>
<p>The employers value diversity and is committed to promoting diversity within the workplace by seeking to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly with dignity and respect and by recognising and encouraging individual contribution within the organisation.</p>
<p>The employers aim to ensure that all employees achieve their full potential and that all employment decisions are taken without reference to irrelevant or discriminatory criteria. The following equality and diversity policy has been adopted as a means of helping to achieve these aims.</p>
<p>The employers are committed to ensuring that all employees and all applicants for employment are protected from unlawful discrimination in the workplace. The employers endeavours not to discriminate in the areas of recruitment, selection, promotion, transfer, training, access to benefits and services, discipline or dismissal. It is also the employers’ policy that all employees should be allowed to work in an environment free from harassment, bullying or unsolicited or unwelcome comments or overtures on discriminatory grounds.</p>
<p>Recruitment and employment decisions will be made on the basis of fair and objective criteria. Our selection procedures are reviewed from time to time to ensure that they are appropriate for achieving our objectives and for avoiding unlawful discrimination.</p>
<p>The requirements of job applicants and existing members of staff who have or have had a disability will be reviewed to ensure that whatever possible reasonable adjustments are made to enable them to enter into or remain in employment with us. Promotion opportunities, benefits and facilities of employment will not be unreasonably limited and every reasonable effort will be made to ensure that disabled staff participate fully in the workplace.</p>
<p>Person and job specifications will be limited to those requirements which are necessary for the effective performance of the job. Interviews will be conducted on an objective basis and personal or home commitments will not form the basis of employment decisions except where necessary.</p>
<p>Appropriate training will be provided to enable staff to implement and uphold our commitment to equality of opportunity and diversity.</p>
<p>All staff have a right to equality of opportunity and dignity at work and a duty to implement this policy. Breach of the equal opportunity and diversity policy is potentially a serious disciplinary matter. Anyone who believes that he or she may have been disadvantaged on discriminatory grounds is entitled to raise the matter through the Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p>The Operation’s Director will have ultimate responsibility for implementation of this policy. The Human Resource Manager will co-ordinate the policy’s implementation and can deal with any queries relating to it.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-discrimination">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">What is discrimination?</a></h2>
<p>Direct discrimination occurs where someone is put at a disadvantage or treated less favourably on discriminatory grounds in relation to his or her employment. Direct discrimination may occur even when unintentional.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A woman with young children fails to obtain a job because it is feared that she might be an unreliable member of staff.</li>
<li>A Sikh applicant for a senior post is not appointed because he might not ‘fit in’ with the existing (all white) team.</li>
<li>A person is subjected to sexual innuendo or other offensive conduct of a sexual nature at work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Indirect discrimination occurs where the individual’s employment is subject to an unjustified provision, criteria or practice which is applied equally to persons of all groups but which puts or would put at a particular disadvantage persons of a particular group and it cannot be shown to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A requirement for GCSE English as a selection criterion. This would have disparately adverse impact on people educated overseas and may not be justified if all that is needed is to demonstrate a reasonable level of literacy.</li>
<li>Full-time work—this would have a disparately adverse impact on more women with small children as they are generally accepted as taking the primary childcare role. It may not be justified if our business needs can still be met by more flexible working arrangements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disability discrimination occurs where an individual is unjustifiably disadvantaged in employment/recruitment for a reason connected with his/her disability unless the discrimination cannot be avoided by making reasonable adjustments.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A requirement for staff to hold a valid driving licence for a job which involves little travelling.</li>
<li>Failure to recruit a wheelchair user without first considering whether the working arrangements or premises can reasonably be adapted to his/her needs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Victimisation occurs where an individual is treated less favourably than colleagues because he/she has taken action, in good faith, to assert their statutory rights or assisted a colleague with information in that regard.</p>
<p>Harassment is unwanted conduct based on discriminatory grounds which affects the dignity of an individual at work or creates an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. Harassment may be visual, verbal or physical. (More details are set out in the employers’ policy on Harassment at Work).</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that all our staff and applicants for employment are protected from unlawful discrimination in employment.</p>

<p>We actively discourage bullying and name calling.
In the event of such activity, the parents of both children are informed immediately and we discuss appropriate action with them.
A member of staff would talk to the child and explain that the behaviour was unkind.
We would take into the account the maturity of the child.
The parent of the child would be told of his inappropriate behaviour and we would work together to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>At the nursery we value and respect all racial origins, religions, cultures and languages.
Each child is valued as an individual, without racial or gender stereotyping.
We endeavour to provide access and facilities for children with special educational needs.
All play equipment is selected to show positive images of all races, cultures and disabilities and to avoid racial or sexist stereotyping.
Our good practice enables children to develop positive attitudes to differences in race, culture, language and gender.</p>

<li>setting suitable learning challenges;</li>
<li>responding to children’s diverse learning needs;</li>
<li>overcoming potential barriers to learning and assessment for individuals and groups of children;</li>
<li>providing other curricular opportunities outside the Early Years Foundation Stage to meet the needs of individuals or groups of children.</li>
</ul>
<p>We achieve educational inclusion by continually reviewing what we do, through asking ourselves these key questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>do all our children achieve their best?</li>
<li>are there differences in the achievement of different groups of children?</li>
<li>what are we doing for those children who we know are not achieving their best?</li>
<li>are our actions effective?</li>
<li>are we successful in promoting racial harmony and preparing children to live in a diverse society?</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff ensure children:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>feel secure and know that their contributions are valued</li>
<li>appreciate and value the differences they see in others</li>
<li>take responsibility for their own actions</li>
<li>participate safely</li>
<li>are taught in groupings that allow them all to experience success</li>
<li>use materials that reflect a range of social and cultural backgrounds, without stereotyping</li>
<li>have a common curriculum experience that allows for a range of different learning styles</li>
<li>have challenging targets that enable them to succeed</li>
<li>are encouraged to participate fully, regardless of disabilities or medical needs</li>
</ul>
<p>We also make ongoing assessments of each child’s progress.
Staff use this information when planning.
It enables them to take into account the abilities of all their children.
When the attainment of a child falls significantly below the expected level, staff enable the child to succeed by planning work that is in line with that child’s individual needs.
Where the attainment of a child significantly exceeds the expected level of attainment, staff use appropriate resources and learning styles, and extend the breadth of work within the area or areas for which the child shows particular aptitude.</p>

<p>Some children in our nursery may have disabilities and consequently may need additional resources.
We are committed to providing an environment that allows these children full access to all areas of learning.
All our entrances are wide enough for wheelchair access.
All staff modify learning as appropriate for these children.
For example, they may give additional time to children with disabilities to complete certain activities.
In their planning teachers ensure that they give children with disabilities the opportunity to develop skills in practical aspects of the curriculum.</p>
<p>The <em>Key Person</em> ensures that their child's work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>takes account of their pace of learning and the equipment they use</li>
<li>takes account of the effort and concentration needed in oral work, or when using, for example, vision aids</li>
<li>is adapted or offers alternative activities in those areas of learning where children are unable to manipulate tools or equipment, or use certain types of materials</li>
<li>allows opportunities for them to take part in educational visits and other activities linked to their learning</li>
<li>includes approaches that allow hearing-impaired children to learn about sound and music, and visually-impaired children to learn about light using visual resources and images</li>
<li>uses assessment techniques that reflect their individual needs and abilities</li>

<div class="section" id="curriculum">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">Curriculum</a></h2>
<p>The curriculum offered in the setting encourages children to develop positive attitudes about themselves as well as to people who are different from themselves.
It encourages children to empathise with others and to begin to develop the skills of critical thinking.
Our environment is as accessible as possible for all visitors and service users.
If access to the settings is found to treat disabled children or adults less favourably then we make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the needs of disabled children and adults.</p>
<p>We do this by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>making children feel valued and good about themselves</li>
<li>ensuring that children have equality of access to learning</li>
<li>undertaking an access audit to establish if the setting is accessible to all children</li>
<li>making adjustments to the environment and resources to accommodate a wide range of learning, physical and sensory impairments</li>
<li>making appropriate provision within the curriculum to ensure each child receives the widest possible opportunity to develop their skills and abilities, e.g. recognising the different learning styles of girls and boys</li>
<li>positively reflecting the widest possible range of communities in the choice of resources</li>
<li>avoiding stereotypes or derogatory images in the selection of books or other visual materials</li>
<li>celebrating a wide range of festivals</li>
<li>creating an environment of mutual respect and tolerance</li>
<li>differentiating the curriculum to meet children’s special educational needs</li>
<li>helping children to understand that discriminatory behaviour and remarks are hurtful and unacceptable</li>

<li>ensuring that children learning English as an additional language have full access to the curriculum and are supported in their learning</li>
