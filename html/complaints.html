<ul class="simple">
<li>Parents may approach Ofsted directly at any stage of this complaints procedure.
In addition,
where there seems to be a possible breach of Lexden Montessori's registration requirements,
it is essential to involve Ofsted
as the registering and inspection body
with a duty to ensure the Welfare Requirements
of the Early Years Foundation Stage
are adhered to.</li>
<li>These details are displayed on our setting's notice board.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be necessary to bring in the local authority registration inspection unit,
who have a duty to ensure laid-down requirements are adhered to
and with whom Lexden Montessori work in partnership to encourage high standards.
The registering authority would be involved
if a child appeared to be at risk
or where there seemed to be a possible breach of registration requirements.</p>
<p>In these cases both parent and nursery would be informed
and a development worker would work with Childrenâ€™s Schools and Families
to ensure a proper investigation of the complaint
followed by appropriate action.</p>
