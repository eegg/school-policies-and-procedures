<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Policy</a></h1>
<p>This setting regards snack and meal times as an important part of the setting's day.
Eating represents a social time for children and adults and helps children to learn about healthy eating.
We promote healthy eating.
At snack and meal times, we provide nutritious food, which meets the children's individual dietary needs.</p>
<p>With reference to hygiene:</p>
<p>We maintain the highest possible food hygiene standards with regard to the purchase, storage, preparation and serving of food.
We are registered as a food provider with the local authority Environmental Health Department.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Hygiene</a></h2>
<p>We serve meals on the basis set out in our <em>Nursery-Specific Policies</em>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The person in charge and the person responsible for food preparation understands the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) as it applies to their business.
This is set out in <em>Safer Food, Better Business</em>.
The basis for this is risk assessment as it applies to the purchase, storage, preparation and serving of food to prevent growth of bacteria and food contamination.</li>
<li>All staff follow the guidelines of <em>Safer Food, Better Business</em>.</li>
<li>At least one person has an in-date Food Hygiene Certificate.</li>
<li>The person responsible for food preparation and serving carries out daily opening and closing checks on the kitchen or food preparation areas to ensure standards are met consistently.</li>
<li>We use reliable suppliers for the food we purchase.</li>
<li>Food is stored at correct temperatures and is checked to ensure it is in-date and not subject to contamination by pests, rodents or mould.</li>
<li>Packed lunches are stored in a cool place</li>
<li>Un-refrigerated food is served to children within 4 hours of preparation at home and must have an ice-pack enclosed.</li>
<li>Food preparation areas are cleaned before use as well as after use.</li>
<li>There are separate facilities for hand-washing and for washing up.</li>
<li>All surfaces are clean. An anti-bacterial spray such as Milton is used before and after preparation and meals.</li>
<li>All utensils, crockery etc are clean and stored appropriately.</li>
<li>Waste food is disposed of daily.</li>
<li>Cleaning materials and other dangerous materials are stored out of children's reach.</li>
<li>Children do not have unsupervised access to the kitchen.</li>
<li>When children take part in cooking activities, they:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>are supervised at all times</li>
<li>understand the importance of hand washing and simple hygiene rules</li>
<li>are kept away from hot surfaces and hot water; and</li>

<div class="section" id="reporting-of-food-poisoning">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Reporting of food poisoning</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Food poisoning can occur for a number of reasons.
Not all cases of sickness or diarrhoea are as a result of food poisoning and not all cases of sickness or diarrhoea are reportable.</li>
<li>Where children or adults have been diagnosed by a GP or hospital doctor to be suffering from food poisoning,
and where it seems possible that the source of the outbreak is within the setting,
the manager will contact the <em>Environmental Health Department</em> and the <em>Health Protection Agency</em> to report the outbreak and will comply with any investigation.</li>
<li>If the food poisoning is identified as a notifiable disease under the <em>Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988</em> the setting will report the matter to Ofsted.</li>

<div class="section" id="breakfast-lunch-and-tea-club">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Breakfast, Lunch and Tea Club</a></h2>
<p>Lexden Montessori provides the opportunity for children to have breakfast, lunch and tea.
We do all we can to ensure that the meals provided have a suitable nutritional value.
Children will have the opportunity throughout the sessions to visit the snack bar where fruit, other nutritional snacks and fresh water are available.
An additional snack time will be held throughout both the morning and afternoon sessions, where milk and fruit is provided.
Our Nursery promotes a healthy lifestyle this is reinforced through our menus and supervision over home packed lunches brought into the setting to ensure they are of nutritional value.
As sweets can damage children’s teeth, we do not allow sweets to be eaten in the setting.</p>
