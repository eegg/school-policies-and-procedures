<p>Snack and meal times are an important part of the day.

They help children learn healthy eating.</p>
<p>We provide food which meets children's individual dietary needs.</p>
<p>The purchase, storage, preparation and serving of food is subject to food hygiene standards.
We are registered as a food provider with the Environmental Health Department.</p>
<p>We serve meals on the basis set out in our <em>Nursery-Specific Policies</em>.</p>

<p>We provide food storage facilities for parentally provided food.
We provide facilities for conventional cooking of meals for the Baby Rooms (under twos) and to either reheat by conventional or by microwave, cooked food brought from home. The nursery will be introducing home-cooked meals to the nursery for the three-five year-olds during 2012.</p>
