<p>Qualifications and training make an important contribution to
the quality of the care and education provided by early years settings.
We offer placements to students undertaking early years qualifications and training.
We also offer placements for school pupils on work experience.
We provide experiences
that contribute to the successful completion of students' studies
and that provide examples of quality practice in early years care and education.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">A potential student makes an application</a></h2>
<p>If requests for admission exceed the number of places available,
potential students will be placed on a waiting list.
The student may be contacted intermittently
to determine whether they are still interested in the place
and to give them an estimate of when the place will become available.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Students on qualification courses must<ul>
<li>meet the 'suitable person' requirements of Ofsted</li>
<li>have enhanced CRB checks carried out</li>

<li>Students under the age of 17 must have their school vouch for their good character.</li>

<p>We follow our staff induction procedure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We supervise students under the age of 17 years at all times and do not allow them to have unsupervised access to children.</li>
<li>Students undertaking qualification courses who are placed in our setting on a short term basis are not counted in our staffing ratios.</li>
<li>Trainee staff employed by the setting may be included in the ratios if they are deemed competent.</li>
<li>We take out employers' liability insurance and public liability insurance, which covers both trainees and voluntary helpers.</li>
<li>We require students to keep to our confidentiality policy.</li>
<li>We co-operate with students' tutors in order to help students to fulfil the requirements of their course of study.</li>
<li>We provide students, at the first session of their placement, with a short induction on how our setting is managed, students are provided with a Safeguarding pack and Safeguarding induction, they are introduced to the named coordinators of special responsibilities, for example, the safeguarding officer, how our sessions are organised and our policies and procedures.</li>
<li>We communicate a positive message to students about the value of qualifications and training.</li>
<li>We make the needs of the children paramount by not admitting students in numbers that hinder the essential work of the setting.</li>
<li>We ensure that trainees and students placed with us are engaged in bona fide early years training, which provides the necessary background understanding of children's development and activities.</li>
