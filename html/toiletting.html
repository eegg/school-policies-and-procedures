<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Policy</a></h1>
<p>We promote independent toileting for all children who are three-years-old and over.</p>
<p>No child is excluded from participating in our setting who may, for any reason, not yet be toilet trained and who may still be wearing nappies or equivalent.
We work with parents towards toilet training, unless there are medical or other developmental reasons why this may not be appropriate at the time.
We make necessary adjustments to our bathroom provision and hygiene practice in order to accommodate children who are not yet toilet trained.
We see toilet training as a self-care skill that children have the opportunity to learn with the full support and non-judgemental concern of adults.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Accompany that child to the nearest vacant of the <em>Children's W.C.s</em>.</li>
<li>Wait inconspicuously for the child to exit or to be available to help the child.</li>
<li>Ask whether they have flushed.</li>
<li>Supervise the child in:</li>
</ol>

<li>washing their hands with soap and water,</li>
<li>drying their hands with a paper towel from the dispenser.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Inconspicuously check the cleanliness of the W.C.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Young children from two years should wear ‘pull ups’ or other types of trainer pants as soon as they are comfortable with this and their parents agree.</li>
<li>Key persons undertake changing young children in their key groups; back up key persons change them if the key person is absent.</li>
<li>Changing areas are warm and there are safe areas to lay young children if they need to have their bottoms cleaned.</li>
<li>Each young child has their own tray to hand with their nappies or ’pull ups’ and changing wipes.</li>
<li>Gloves and aprons are put on before changing starts and the areas are prepared.
Paper towel is put down on the changing mat freshly for each child.</li>
<li>All staff are familiar with the hygiene procedures and carry these out when changing nappies.</li>
<li>In addition, key persons ensure that nappy changing is relaxed and a time to promote independence in young children.</li>
<li>Young children are encouraged to take an interest in using the toilet; they may just want to sit on it and talk to a friend who is also using the toilet.</li>
<li>They should be encouraged to wash their hands and have soap and towels to hand.
They should be allowed time for some play as they explore the water and the soap.</li>
<li>Key persons are gentle when changing; they avoid pulling faces and making negative comment about ‘nappy contents’.</li>
<li>Key persons do not make inappropriate comments about young children’s genitals when changing their nappies</li>
<li>Older children access the toilet when they have the need to and are encouraged to be independent.</li>
<li>Nappies and ’pull ups’ are disposed of hygienically.
Any soil (faeces) in nappies or pull ups is flushed down the toilet and the nappy or pull up is bagged and put in the bin.
Cloth nappies, trainer pants and ordinary pants that have been wet or soiled are rinsed and bagged for the parent to take home.</li>
<li><em>n.b.</em> If young children are left in wet or soiled nappies/pull-ups in the setting this may constitute neglect and will be a disciplinary matter.
Settings have a ‘duty of care’ towards children’s personal needs.</li>
