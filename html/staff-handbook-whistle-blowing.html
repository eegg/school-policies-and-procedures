<h1>Policy</h1>
<p>This section provides a guide to our whistle-blowing policy, a full copy of which is available upon request from your manager.</p>
<p>The employers at all times seeks to conduct its business observing the highest standards of integrity and honesty. It expects all employees to maintain the same standards in everything they do. Employees are therefore requested to report to the employers any wrongdoing by the employers or its employees that falls short of this principle.</p>
<p>The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 protects employees who, in good faith, report to their employer or specific external organisations wrongdoing within the workplace. It is the aim of this policy, however, to ensure that as far as possible employees feel confident and happy to tell us about any actual or perceived internal wrongdoing that they believe has occurred or is likely to occur.</p>
<p>All employees are requested to use the procedure set out below if they have any concerns at all about wrongdoing at work, including any criminal offence, a failure to comply with a legal obligation, a miscarriage of justice, a danger to health and safety, an environmental risk, an act of misconduct, dishonesty, or a deliberate cover-up of any of these matters.</p>
<p>Employees may be concerned about the repercussions to them in reporting matters that are of concern. We promise that all employees will be protected and will not be subjected to any detriment because they have reported a matter that they believe, in good faith, to amount to wrongdoing or potential wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Employees, however, must note that if they make any allegation that they do not reasonably believe or which is made maliciously or for some ulterior motive (i.e. a grudge against a fellow worker) then this may be treated as a disciplinary matter and we may invoke the Disciplinary Procedure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reporting-wrongdoing">
<h1>Reporting wrongdoing</h1>
<p>In the first instance the employee may wish to raise the matter with their manager on an informal basis and discuss with him or her what steps should be taken to report the matter to more senior management.</p>
<p>Employees may at any time raise the matter formally with their manager, whether orally or in writing and he or she will then pass on the matter to the appropriate level of management.</p>
<p>If the employee’s concern is about their manager, or someone at a higher level of management, then the employee should feel free to raise the matter with whomever the employee considers to be the appropriate level of management.</p>
<p>At all stages any statements that the employee makes will remain confidential so far as practical unless the employee expresses a contrary wish or it becomes necessary to divulge such statements during the course of an investigation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="investigations">
<h1>Investigations</h1>
<p>Once an employee has reported a matter covered by this policy, we will normally conduct a preliminary enquiry to decide if a full investigation is needed. If an investigation is necessary, depending on the nature of the allegations, the investigation will either be carried out internally or referred to an appropriate external body (for example the police).</p>
<p>The employee will normally be informed before any of the matters that the employee has raised are put to the alleged wrongdoer. The employee will be protected by us. We will ensure that the employee’s work environment is not affected because the employee disclosed the matter to us.</p>
<p>Subject to any legal restrictions, the employee will be informed of the outcome of any investigation and what action has been taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="raising-concerns">
<h1>Raising concerns</h1>
<p>If an employee has any concern or complaint about the manner in which he or she feels they are being treated because they are the employee who made the disclosure, whether by the alleged wrongdoer or any co-employees, the employee should raise this with whatever level of management the employee considers to be appropriate. This may be dealt with as a disciplinary matter in relation to such individuals.</p>
<p>If the employee is unhappy about the speed or the manner in which their disclosure was treated by the person to whom it was reported or the employee considers that it is not being properly investigated then the employee should report the matter to whatever level of management the employee considers appropriate which may include a director of the employers</p>
<p>We will not tolerate any detrimental treatment of any employee as a result of their reporting concerns, provided the employee has acted in good faith.</p>
