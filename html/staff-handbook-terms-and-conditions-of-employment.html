</div>
<div class="section" id="holidays">
<h1>2.17Holidays</h1>
<p>Your annual paid holiday entitlement is confirmed in your contract of employment.</p>
<p>The standard holiday year operates between 1st April to 31st March</p>
<p>When making your holiday plans the following rules should be followed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You must obtain the prior written permission of your manager before committing yourself to bookings or any alternative positive arrangements.</li>
<li>There may be weeks, due to operating or holiday periods where it may be necessary to restrict or prohibit staff from taking holiday. Every effort will be made to avoid such circumstances, but if this does occur holiday will be allocated on a first booked basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>To book your holiday you must:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get an Annual Leave Form from your manager.</li>
<li>Fill in the holiday request form completing a box for every day you wish to take off.</li>
<li>If you are taking a half-day please write this on the form below the relevant date.</li>
<li>Pass the form to your manager for authorisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other considerations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You should not normally plan to take more than 10 days at any one time. A longer period requires your manager’s agreement and may be granted only in special circumstances.</li>
<li>One uninterrupted holiday of at least 5 working days and not more than 10 working days must be taken, to be notified to your manager 6 weeks’ in advance for approval. The remainder may be taken in shorter periods at 6 weeks’ notice, timing also being subject to your manager’s approval.</li>
<li>You may not take annual holiday until after the successful completion of your probationary period of employment other than at the discretion of your manager. However, your holiday entitlement is calculated from the start date or your employment.</li>
<li>In special circumstances, such as a new employee being committed to holiday arrangements before joining or a justifiable request from an employee for additional leave over and above entitlement, your manager may authorise appropriate additional leave, which will normally be unpaid.</li>
<li>You must take all your holiday entitlement in the holiday year. Unused holiday cannot be carried over into the next holiday year.</li>
<li>The Company may require you to take any outstanding accrued holiday entitlement during your notice period.</li>
<li>The employers do not expect employees to lose holiday leave through genuine sickness. Therefore holidays in lieu (taken by agreement with your manager) are permitted in cases of sickness during holidays that were covered by a medical certificate.</li>
<li>For all employees in the holiday year in which your employment commences or terminates your holiday entitlement will be calculated on a pro rata basis (rounded up/down to the nearest complete day) for each complete month worked.</li>
<li>If you resign or are dismissed and you have not taken your full accrued holiday entitlement, you will be paid for your accrued entitlement up to the date of termination of your employment. If you have taken holiday in excess of your entitlement then, upon termination, the employers will be entitled to reimbursement for any overpayment.</li>
<li>Holiday entitlement for part-time employees is calculated on a pro rata basis. The calculation is based on the contractual number of hours worked per week by you against the full time hours of work for the same job. This means, for example, that if you work half the number of days or hours compared to a full time employee, your holiday entitlement will be half of the full time entitlement.</li>
<li>In relation to any holiday entitlement this is deemed to include your entitlement to statutory leave under the Working Time Regulations 1998 and this is deemed to be taken first.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="absence-from-work-due-to-ill-health">
<h1>2.18Absence from work due to ill health</h1>
<p>The general rule is that you are required to be available for work during your normal working hours and you must make every effort to attend work. Unauthorised absence from work is considered a breach of discipline and may result in disciplinary action being taken against you.</p>
<div class="section" id="sickness-and-injury">
<h2>2.18.1Sickness and injury</h2>
<p>The Company’s rules for notifying sickness and injury are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You shall notify, or someone on your behalf should notify, your manager as early as possible on your first day of absence and in any event by no later than 9.00 a.m.</li>
<li>You must state the reason for your absence and the date on which you expect to return. Only when you are unable to telephone personally should someone else notify your manager on your behalf.</li>
<li>When you are ill regular contact by you, or someone else on your behalf, must be maintained on subsequent days of absence with your manager.</li>
<li>When you return to work after a period of absence of seven days or less a self certification form and absence statement must be completed by you. The form and statement must be signed by you and your manager.</li>
<li>If your absence lasts for more than seven days (including weekends) you must submit a doctor’s medical certificate to your manager to cover the entire period of your absence. Further certificates will be required to cover your total period of absence. It is your responsibility to keep the employers normally via your manager, informed about your progress and your likely date of return.</li>
<li>The employers may request a doctor’s certificate for frequent periods of absence for seven calendar days or less. Any costs in obtaining the certificate in these circumstances will be reimbursed by the employers.</li>
<li>The employers’ reserve the right to request a home visit upon reasonable notice or to make contact with you during the period of absence.</li>
<li>When you return to work, after any period of ill health, your manager may hold a ‘return to work’ interview with you to discuss your absence and the reasons for it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conduct-during-sickness-absence">
<h2>2.18.2Conduct during sickness absence</h2>
<p>To help you understand what might raise doubts or queries in the mind of your manager concerning any medical statements (or self-certificates), the employers have drawn up some guidelines for employees concerning their conduct and activities during any periods of absence due to sickness or injury.</p>
<p>In all cases of sickness or injury which necessitates taking time off work, it is expected that the employee will do his/her utmost to facilitate a speedy return to fitness and to work. In this regard, employees are expected to act sensibly and honestly.</p>
<p>The employers would not in the normal case expect any employee who is absent from work due to sickness or injury to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Participate in any sports, hobbies or social or any other activities, meetings etc which are in any way inconsistent with his alleged illness or injuries or which could aggravate the illness or injury or which could delay recovery;</li>
<li>Undertake any other employment whether paid or unpaid. If you declare yourself incapacitated from work in relation to your employment with us, it will be deemed gross or serious misconduct to undertake any other duties whilst of sick – clearly the employers would expect you to do everything to aid speedy recovery;</li>
<li>Engage in any work around the home in terms of home improvements or the like;</li>
<li>Engage in any activity which is inconsistent with the nature of the alleged illness or injuries (e.g. be seen walking round town with bags of shopping with an alleged injury).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="long-term-or-persistent-sickness-absence">
<h2>2.18.3Long term or persistent sickness absence</h2>
<p>The efficiency of the businesses depends upon you regularly attending work. Your long term or persistent absence, therefore, jeopardises the employer’s efficiency. In such circumstances, where you are unable to make regular and reliable attendance at work, subject to the employers making such investigations as it thinks fit, this may result in your employment with the employers coming to an end.</p>
<p>Repeated or prolonged absences of any kind may also result in disciplinary action against you. For example, intermittent absences, particularly for unconnected reasons or on odd days can cause considerable disruption to the employers’ activities and will not normally be tolerated.</p>
<p>The employers reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time during your absence from work even though at the time of giving notice you remain entitled to SSP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alternative-employment">
<h2>2.18.4Alternative employment</h2>
<p>If as a result of a degenerative or long term medical condition/restriction you are unable to perform the duties of your normal position, the employers will explore and consider the availability of any suitable alternative work that you may be able to undertake and seek to discuss any such options with you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="medical-examination">
<h2>2.18.5Medical examination</h2>
<p>All employees are required to attend, at any time during the course of their employment, at the request of the employers a medical examination by a registered medical practitioner nominated by the employers. The purpose of such medical examination shall be to determine whether there are any matters which might impair your ability to perform your duties and accordingly you will give such authority as is required for the employers nominated doctor to disclose to them the findings. All expenses associated with obtaining the report will be paid by the employers.</p>
<p>In the event that you or a medical practitioner provides information to the employers concerning your health, you expressly consent to them retaining such information on your personal file for so long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of ensuring that the employers comply in full with its obligations under health and safety legislation and of effectively managing the aspects of its business in which you are involved.</p>
<p>Any unreasonable refusal to co-operate with the employers, during any period of sickness absence, without good cause, including a failure or refusal to attend for a medical examination or correspond or communicate or meet with the employers could lead to your summary dismissal. Only where an expert medical practitioner certifies that any such communication would seriously harm or worsen your medical condition, would the employers deem it reasonable for you not to communicate or meet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accidents-at-work">
<h2>2.18.6Accidents at work</h2>
<p>Absences resulting from accidents at work are treated as ill health absences and the employers normal rules will apply to such absences.</p>
