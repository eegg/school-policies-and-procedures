<p>Children benefit from being taken out of the setting to go on visits or trips to local parks or other suitable venues for activities which enhance their learning experiences.
Some settings do not have direct access to outdoor provision on their premises and will need to take children out daily.
Staff in our setting ensure that there are procedures to keep children safe on outings; all staff and volunteers are aware of and follow the procedures below.</p>
<p>Different types of outings take place and each will require slightly different preparations and staffing levels.
These include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Trips on foot, e.g. visits to the park, the library, local markets and places of interest</li>
<li>Trips on public transport to places like museums, farms, //etc.//</li>
