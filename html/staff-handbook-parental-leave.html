<h1>Policy</h1>
<p>This policy explains the employers approach to parental leave. It provides general guidance only and it does not cover every point or situation. Please contact the HR department if you have any doubts about how the policy operates in practice or if you have any other questions relating to parental leave.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all employees who meet the eligibility conditions explained below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-parental-leave">
<h1>What is parental leave?</h1>
<p>Parental leave is a right to take unpaid time off work to look after a child or make arrangements for the child’s welfare.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-can-take-parental-leave">
<h1>Who can take parental leave?</h1>
<p>You are entitled to parental leave provided you satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>you have a child born on or after 15 December 1999 and you have been continuously employed for at least one year by the time you want to take the leave; or</li>
<li>you have a child born or placed for adoption between 15 December 1994 and 14 December 1999 and you have either (a) worked for the employers continuously for one year by the time you want to take the leave, or (b) have worked for a previous employer continuously for a year during the period 15 December 1998 and 9 January 2002</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case you must have, or expect to have, ‘parental responsibility’ for a child. This means that you must be named on the child’s birth certificate or must have, or expect to have, parental responsibility under the law for the child. (For example, some guardians may also have parental responsibility for a child). The parents of a child do not have to be living with the child in order to qualify for parental leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="length-of-parental-leave-that-applies-in-every-case">
<h1>Length of parental leave that applies in every case</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>13 weeks’ parental leave for each child; or 18 weeks for each child entitled to Disability Living Allowance. Therefore, if an employee has twins or triplets, they are entitled to 13 weeks’ leave per child. Parents of disabled children are entitled to 18 weeks per child.</li>
<li>Leave must be taken by the child’s fifth birthday. (Parents of disabled children born on or after 15 December 1994 are able to use their leave over a longer period of until the child’s 18th birthday).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="length-of-parental-leave-that-applies-in-different-cases">
<h1>Length of parental leave that applies in different cases</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the case of children born or adopted on or after 15 December 1999, the employee’s right to take parental leave lasts until the child’s fifth birthday (or until five years have elapsed following placement in the case of adoption).</li>
<li>In the case of children born or adopted between 15 December 1994 and 14 December 1999, the right to take parental leave lasts until 31 March 2005, (or in the case of adoption until the child’s 18th birthday if that is sooner). In this case, you must have completed one year’s continuous service with the Company between 15 December 1998 and 9 January 2002.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="period-of-leave">
<h1>Period of leave</h1>
<p>If you work part-time, your period of leave is reduced in proportion to your reduced working hours.</p>
<p>The right to parental leave is a right to take up to 13 weeks per child in total and not 13 weeks during successive contracts with different employers. The employers will, therefore, ask you (and may ask any previous employers) to confirm how much parental leave you have already taken, before granting any request for leave.</p>
<p>You may apply to take parental leave in blocks of one week (or, if their child is disabled, in blocks of one day) up to a maximum of four weeks for any individual child in any one year. For this purpose a ‘year’ is each successive period of twelve months, starting on the date you are first eligible to take parental leave.</p>
<p>Please note that if you take leave of one week or less this is nevertheless still classed as taking one complete week’s leave.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="when-can-leave-be-taken">
<h1>When can leave be taken?</h1>
<p>You may take leave when your child is born (or placed with you for adoption) or, if later, as soon as you have completed one year’s continuous service.</p>
<p>Special rules apply if your child is disabled. In those circumstances, you may take leave at any time up to the child’s 18th birthday.</p>
<p>If the employers postpone your leave, you will still be able to take it, even after the dates mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="application-for-parental-leave">
<h1>Application for parental leave</h1>
<div class="section" id="minimum-notice">
<h2>Minimum notice</h2>
<p>If you wish to apply for parental leave you must complete a Request for Parental Leave Form available from the HR department.</p>
<p>You must give at least 21 days’ notice of when you want to take leave and confirm the proposed start and end dates.</p>
<p>In the following circumstances, it may not be possible for you to give the exact date on which you want to start your leave.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you are the father who wishes to take leave immediately after the birth of his child.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these circumstances, your application must confirm the expected week of childbirth and length of leave you wish to take. It should be submitted to the HR department at least 21 days before the expected week of childbirth.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a child is to be placed with you for adoption and the exact date of the placement is not known.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should confirm the week in which the placement is expected to occur and the length of leave you wish to take. The application should be submitted to HR department at least 21 days before the beginning of the week when the placement is expected, or if that is not possible, as soon as the circumstances allow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="supporting-evidence">
<h2>Supporting evidence</h2>
<p>The first time you request parental leave for a child, you must include with your application evidence of the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>your responsibility for the child;</li>
<li>the child’s date of birth or, in the case of an adopted child, the date on which the adoption began;</li>
<li>in the case of a disabled child aged over five, the child’s entitlement to a Disability Living Allowance.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should also confirm whether you have previously taken parental leave for that child and, if so, when you took the leave and for how long.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="postponement-of-leave">
<h2>Postponement of leave</h2>
<p>Your manager will consider your request. Unless your parental leave is to start on the birth of your child, or when the child is first placed with you for adoption, your leave may be postponed in the following circumstances:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>where you have not told us at least 21 days before the leave is to begin, of the dates on which you want the leave to start and end; or</li>
<li>where the business of the employers would be unduly disrupted by you taking leave during the time you have proposed; or</li>
<li>after consulting with you, we decide that you should take the same period of leave within the next six months.</li>
</ol>
<p>In each of these cases the employers will notify you in writing within seven days of receiving your request for leave as to why your leave is being postponed and we will confirm the dates on which you may take leave and for how long.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rights-during-parental-leave">
<h1>Rights during parental leave</h1>
<p>Parental leave is unpaid. This means that during any period of parental leave, you will not be paid your salary or wages.</p>
<p>Your contractual benefits will not continue to accrue during your parental leave but your contract continues to exist and you will benefit from the employers duty of trust and confidence to you and any terms and conditions of employment relating to:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Notice of termination</li>
<li>Compensation in the event of redundancy</li>
<li>Disciplinary or grievance procedures.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are also bound during the period by your duty of good faith to the employers and any terms and conditions of employment relating to:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Notice of termination</li>
<li>Disclosure of confidential information</li>
<li>Acceptance of gifts or other benefits</li>
<li>Participation in any other business.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will also benefit from all your statutory employment rights during your parental leave.</p>
<p>If you are a member of the employers pension scheme, your membership will be suspended while you are on parental leave. No contributions will be paid into the scheme during that period and the period for which they are on parental leave will not count as pensionable service.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="return-to-work-after-your-parental-leave">
<h1>Return to work after your parental leave</h1>
<p>After parental leave of four weeks or less, you are entitled to return to the job you had before your leave. If your parental leave was for a longer period, you are entitled to return to the same job, or if that is not reasonably practicable, a similar job which has the same or better status, terms and conditions of your old job.</p>
<p>If you decide not to return to work after parental leave, then you must give the required notice under your contract of employment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parental-leave-after-maternity-leave">
<h1>Parental leave after maternity leave</h1>
<p>Any employee entitled to maternity leave is also entitled to take up to four weeks’ parental leave immediately after their maternity leave.</p>
<p>If an employee takes up to four weeks’ parental leave immediately after Ordinary Maternity Leave, they are entitled to return to the job they had before their maternity leave. If they take up to four weeks’ parental leave immediately after Additional Maternity Leave, they are entitled to return to the job before their maternity leave, or if that is not reasonably practicable, to a job which is suitable and appropriate for them on no less favourable terms.</p>
<p>Please refer to the employers Maternity Policy for further details.</p>
<p>Paternity leave and pay</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This policy provides a summary of the rules governing paternity leave and pay provisions. It gives general guidance only and it does not cover every aspect of this entitlement. If you have any questions or requests for more information please speak, in confidence, to your manager or contact the HR department.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-time-employees">
<h1>Part-time employees</h1>
<p>All the rights summarised in this policy apply to full-time and part-time employees, no matter how many hours they work, provided they satisfy any qualifying conditions, such as length of service.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="eligibility">
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>In order to qualify for paternity leave you must have, or expect to have, responsibility for your baby’s up bringing and you must:-</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be the biological father of the child or the mother’s husband or ‘partner’;</li>
<li>Have worked continuously for the employers for 26 weeks leading into the 15th week before the baby is due (the ‘qualifying week’) and from the 15th week before the baby is due up to the date of birth;</li>
<li>Be taking the time off either to support the mother or to care for the new baby.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-paternity-leave-for">
<h1>What is paternity leave for?</h1>
<p>You can only take paternity leave in order to care for your new baby or to support the mother of the baby – you cannot take leave for any other purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-qualifies-as-a-partner">
<h1>Who qualifies as a ‘partner’?</h1>
<p>For the purpose of deciding if you are eligible for paternity leave, a partner is someone who lives with the mother of the baby in an enduring family relationship but is not an immediate relative.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="length-of-paternity-leave">
<h1>Length of paternity leave</h1>
<p>If you are eligible for paternity leave, you can choose to take either one week or two consecutive weeks’ paternity leave. It cannot be taken as odd days or as two separate weeks. (You can take only one period of paternity leave even if more than one baby is born as the result of the same pregnancy).</p>
<p>Leave cannot start until the birth of the baby. Otherwise, you can choose to start your leave:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the date of the baby’s birth (whether this is earlier or later than expected); or</li>
<li>On a date falling on such number of days after the date on which the child is born (whether this earlier or later than expected) as you notify to the employers; or</li>
<li>On a chosen date as notified to the employers which falls after the first day of the expected week of childbirth.</li>
</ol>
<p>Paternity leave can start on any day of the week on or following the child’s birth, but it must be completed:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Within 56 days of the actual date of the birth of the child; or</li>
<li>If the child is born early, within the period from the actual date of birth up to 56 days after the expected week of birth.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, you must give to the employers the required notice of your leave – see below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statutory-paternity-pay">
<h1>Statutory paternity pay</h1>
<p>During your paternity leave, you will be entitled to Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP) paid by the employers.</p>
<p>SPP will be paid to you for either of one or two consecutive weeks as you have chosen. The rate of statutory paternity pay will be the same as the standard rate of statutory maternity pay. Currently this is £100 a week or 90% of average weekly earnings if you earn less than £100. (Employees who have average weekly earns below the lower earnings limit for National Insurance purposes do not qualify for SPP. In such cases they will be eligible for Income Support once on maternity leave).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notice-of-intention-to-take-paternity-leave">
<h1>Notice of intention to take paternity leave</h1>
<p>To qualify for paternity leave you must tell the employer that you intend to take paternity leave by the end of the 15th week before the week your baby is due or, if this is not possible, as soon as is reasonably practicable. You will need to tell the employers:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The expected week of the baby’s birth;</li>
<li>Whether you wish to take one or two weeks’ leave;</li>
<li>When you want to start your leave;</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be able to change your mind about the date on which you want your leave to start providing you tell the employers at least 28 days in advance (unless this is not reasonably practicable).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notice-of-intention-to-claim-spp">
<h1>Notice of intention to claim SPP</h1>
<p>To qualify for SPP, you must tell the employers that you want to get SPP at least 28 days before hand. Where you are entitled to both pay and leave, the notice given for leave by the 15th week before the week the baby is due, can count for pay as well.</p>
<p>To claim SPP you must, in addition, make a declaration (see below). You must also tell the employers when your baby was actually born as soon as is reasonably practicable after the birth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="self-certificate-declaration">
<h1>Self-certificate declaration</h1>
<p>To get SSP, you must give the employers a signed declaration that you:-</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Are taking leave to either care for your child or to support the mother or both;</li>
<li>Have, or expect to have, responsibility of the up bringing of the child;</li>
<li>You are the father of the child and/or the partner or husband of the mother;</li>

You will also be entitled to benefit from any general improvements to the rate of pay or other terms and conditions introduced while you were away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paternity-leave-and-parental-leave">
<h1>Paternity leave and parental leave</h1>
<p>If you intend to take parental leave immediately before or after your paternity leave you should give the required notice for parental leave as well as your notice for paternity leave. For further details about parental leave see the employers’ policy set out in this handbook.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="returning-to-work-after-a-period-of-parental-leave-or-any-other-statutory-leave-immediately-before-or-after-paternity-leave">
<h1>Returning to work after a period of parental leave or any other statutory leave immediately before or after paternity leave</h1>
<p>When your paternity leave is followed by a period of parental leave or vice versa, and you take up to four weeks’ parental leave you are entitled to return to the same job on the same terms and conditions as if you had not been absent. If you take more than four weeks’ parental leave (or periods of additional paternity or adoption leave) you are still entitled to return to your same job on the same terms and conditions as if you had not been absent unless this is not reasonably practicable, in which case you are entitled to be offered a similar job.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="maternity-rights-flowchart">
<h1>Maternity rights flowchart</h1>
<p>The flowchart on pages 23 and 24 sets out the key maternity rights and notification requirements for both ordinary and additional maternity leave. To take advantage of maternity leave, employees must give proper notification. This requirement is included in the flowchart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ordinary-maternity-leave">
<h1>Ordinary maternity leave</h1>
<p>All pregnant employees are entitled to at least 26 weeks’ ordinary maternity leave. This applies regardless of length of service.

<div class="section" id="return-to-work-part-time-after-maternity-leave-and-the-right-to-request-flexible-working">
<h1>Return to work part-time after maternity leave and the right to request flexible working</h1>
<p>There is no specific right for female employees to change their working conditions, including hours of work, on returning to work from maternity leave. However, all employees (male and female) who are parents of young children have the statutory right to request flexible working patterns. The employers will give such requests serious consideration. In order to qualify for this right a parent must:-</p>
