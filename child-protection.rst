Policies
--------


Child protection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The named person with responsibility for child protection in the nursery is the managers.
We will follow the procedures for child protection (see Child Protection Policy).
If any member of staff suspects that a child in their class may be the victim of abuse, they should not try to investigate, but should immediately inform the person responsible in the nursery for child protection (the managers) about their concerns.
We require all adults employed in the nursery to have an up to date CRB record, in order to check that there is no evidence of offences involving children or abuse.
All the adults in our nursery share responsibility for keeping our children safe.
We may on occasion report concerns which, on investigation, prove unfounded.
It is better to be safe than sorry, and we trust that parents, while they will naturally be upset, will nevertheless accept that the nursery acted in the child’s best interests.


Nursery security
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While it is difficult to make the nursery site totally secure, we will do all we can to ensure that the nursery is a safe environment for the children to play and learn in and staff to work in.
We review security measures regularly, and carry out a daily Risk Assessment and draw upon the advice of experts (e.g. police officers, fire officers, architects and other consultants).
We require all adult visitors who arrive in normal nursery hours to sign the visitors’ book in the reception area, and to wear an identification badge at all times whilst on the nursery premises.


Stranger awareness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Staff are constantly alert to any strangers on the premises.
We will not open the door to anyone that is unknown to us and will NEVER release a child to anybody other than the parent/guardian unless a permission form is signed.
Children’s names and identity are protected at all times and staff will not disclose information about any child attending the nursery to any person other than those immediately responsible for the child.
If the child was the subject of a child protection issue, information would only be shared with Social Services or other agencies involved in a strictly confidential manner.
Parents have a responsibility to inform staff if anyone other than themselves is collecting their child for whatever reason.
Staff will ask parent to complete form situated in the cloakroom area as to who is going to be collecting their child only then will they be released from our care.
If we are unsure at any time, parents will be contacted to confirm the identity of any person.


Safety of children
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is the responsibility of all staff to ensure that all activities are safe.
Similarly, staff will always be vigilant for hazards concerning equipment or activities.
If a member of staff has any concerns about the children’s safety, they should bring them to the attention of the manager before that particular activity takes place.
We do not take any child off the school site without the prior permission of the parent.
If an accident does happen, and it results in an injury to a child, the staff will do all he can to aid the child concerned.
We keep a first aid box in the kitchen area.
All staff are First Aid trained and certificates are kept on the premises.
Should any incident involving injury to a child take place, one of the members of staff who have been first aid trained will be called to assist.
If necessary emergency assistance will be called for.
We record any accident in the accident file involving injury, and in all cases we inform parents and they sign an Accident Form to confirm they have been informed.
Should a child be quite seriously hurt, we contact the parents through the emergency telephone number that we keep on file.
We update these numbers annually, but it is essential that parents inform us when contact details change.
If we cannot reach the parent/guardian or emergency contact we will refer to the Pupil Information Sheet.
There may be rare occasions where it is necessary for staff to restrain a pupil physically, to prevent them from inflicting injury to others, causing self-injury, damaging property, or being disruptive.
In such cases only the minimum force necessary may be used, and any action taken must be only to restrain the pupil.



Personal, Social, Emotional, Development

We teach the children about health and safety in order to equip them with the skills, knowledge and understanding that will enable them to live positive, successful and healthy lives.
Staff take every opportunity to educate children in this regard as part of the Statutory Framework for Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS).

We teach children respect for their bodies, and how to look after themselves.
We discuss these issues with the children in circle times, We also show them how to move and play safely through Physical Development.
Within the Nursery we try to promote everyone’s safety, so we teach children to spot hazards in both the indoor and outdoor environment, and inform a member of staff.


Breakfast, Lunch and Tea Club
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*The Setting* provides the opportunity for children to have breakfast, lunch and tea.
We do all we can to ensure that the meals provided have a suitable nutritional value.
Children will have the opportunity throughout the sessions to visit the snack bar where fruit, other nutritional snacks and fresh water are available.
An additional snack time will be held throughout both the morning and afternoon sessions, where milk and fruit is provided.
Our Nursery promotes a healthy lifestyle this is reinforced through our menus and supervision over home packed lunches brought into the setting to ensure they are of nutritional value.
As sweets can damage children’s teeth, we do not allow sweets to be eaten in the setting.


Internet safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We regularly use the Internet in the nursery, because it has many educational benefits.
In order to minimise the risk of children coming across unsuitable material, we provide constant supervision, and we use only a filtered service, selected links, and child-friendly search engines.
Parents are asked to sign authorisation for their child to use the Internet.
We also seek parental permission before using photographs of children or their work on the nursery’s website, or in newsletters and other publications.


The health and welfare of staff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The nursery takes very seriously the need to safeguard the health and welfare of all our staff.
This includes their professional development, which we address in our CPD policy.
We also pay particular attention to the assessment and prevention of work-related stress, thus complying with health and safety law.
If a member of staff is experiencing stress at work, he should inform the managers without delay.
The nursery will not tolerate violence, threatening behaviour or abuse directed against members of staff.
If such incidents do occur, the nursery will take the matter very seriously, and take action in line with the LEA’s policy.
The nursery, in consultation with professional advisors, carries out regular risk assessments, with the object of keeping the nursery environment safe.
The managers implement the school’s health, safety and welfare policy on a day-to-day basis, and ensure that all staff are aware of the details of the policy as it applies to them.
